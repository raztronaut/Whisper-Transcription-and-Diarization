[SPEAKER_14] 749.1s - 836.3s:  Thank you. I would like to take a moment on behalf of Council to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples of all the lands that we are on today.  We do this to reaffirm our commitment and responsibility in improving relationships between nations and to deepening our own understanding of Indigenous peoples and their cultures.  It is a moment to reflect on the importance of this land, which we each call home.  We acknowledge the land we are meeting on is the traditional territory of many nations, including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishinaabe, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee, and the Wendats people,  and is now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit, and MÃ©tis peoples.  We also acknowledge that Toronto is covered by Treaty 13, with the Mississaugas of the Credit and the Williams Treaty signed with multiple Mississaugas and Chippewa bands.  For the benefit of those who are connected to the internet, City Clerk has posted all of the agenda materials for today's meeting at toronto.ca slash council.  This meeting is being held as a hybrid meeting and is being streamed live on YouTube.  I'd like to welcome the public who are here with us today and who are watching the meeting online.  Members, we do have a presentation this morning to recognize the 150 years of firefighting in Toronto.  I would like to call upon Mayor Chao to give the presentation.
[SPEAKER_11] 845.5s - 910.7s:  Good morning.  We are pleased to have joining us today a number of guests, including Interim Fire Chief Larry Coco,  Deputy Fire Chief Jim Jessup, Paul Fitzgerald, and Kevin Helmerton, and Laura Boyd,  along with other Toronto services staff members.  President James Reid of the Toronto Professional Firefighters Association and their executive team are also here.  Chief Brett Crimm Schala from Toronto Paramedic Services,  and the staff superintendent Brett Nicole from Toronto Police Services,  along with members of the Toronto Fire Historical Society Toronto Fire Service Honour Guards,  Toronto Fire Service Pipe and Drum Band, and Toronto Fire Services World Veterans Association Colour Guard.  Welcome to the Council Chamber.
[SPEAKER_11] 919.9s - 1132.3s:  The City of Toronto is proud to have a fire service that delivers world-class fire protection services  to the people who live, work, and play in the city.  Today we have the privilege of celebrating 150 years of dedicated fire protection services in the City of Toronto,  an incredible milestone that highlights our long-standing commitment to safety and community resilience.  For many years, Toronto was served by a volunteer fire department,  and in 1874, the City Council of the day saw the importance of a full-time fire department  to give the residents of Toronto the best fire protection service possible.  At the time, the full-time department had just over 36 full-time members and used five horse-drawn fire engines,  but they were at the fire stations day and night.  Since that time, the city has transformed dramatically.  The five horses have been replaced with 124 trucks, cobblestone streets replaced by pavement,  and wooden homes by concrete towers reaching high into the sky.  By the late 80s, the six fire departments serving each district corner of the pre-amalgamated city became one,  and we now have a fire service with 3,327 full-time staff serving the residents, businesses, and visitors of Toronto,  providing service from 84 fire stations around the city.  Today, we celebrate this incredible milestone.  We are joined by members of the Fire Services and Toronto Professional Firefighters Association  and countless others, both past and present, that represent the rich history and legacy of Toronto Fire Services.  This dedication of our Toronto Fire Services is commendable.  Their commitment to courage, compassion, and service reflects the core values that guides them in protecting our community.  Celebrating 150 years of world-class fire protection service is a remarkable achievement,  and one I, as the mayor, and we, as city council, are incurably proud of.  This achievement highlights the professionalism through changing times.  We, as a city council, remain committed to supporting these vital services,  ensuring that the residents of Toronto continue to receive world-class fire protection services.  So, on behalf of Toronto City Council and the residents of Toronto, congratulations on this achievement,  and thank you for protecting our city.  And now, we'll conclude this presentation with a short video highlighting 150 years of firefighting in Toronto.  Let's give them a big round of applause before we see the video.
[SPEAKER_10] 1416.6s - 1516.2s:  I just want to stand up for a second, because this 150th anniversary is such an important one.  It also found time as the open house that Toronto Fire has every year.  I was so pleased, because the Fire Academy is in my ward.  I attended with the mayor, and there was over 2,000 Torontonians who took advantage and came through that day.  They saw so many things. They got education on fire. They saw how firefighters run up buildings.  They saw everything, and so many kids said, I want to be a firefighter.  So, that was pretty exciting.  Unfortunately, also, as the mayor pointed out, the statistic on the number of homes that have smoke detectors  is only every four out of ten homes.  So, that's a very low number, and I think probably on this 150th anniversary,  all of us as councillors in our communications could certainly promote that a bit more,  because that's quite a surprising statistic.  I also note that shortly after, very close to the Fire Academy, just down the street on Magee,  there was a fire that night where three homes were burnt because of somebody fixing their roof  and couldn't put the fire out.  Of course, our fire department was right there and got it out,  and as always, kept me in the loop as councillor as to what was happening and how difficult that fire was.  So, I just want to thank everybody again for that.
[SPEAKER_10] 1518.6s - 1694.4s:  Because when we were at Chief Pegg's retirement, there was something very special that he got.  He got a lot of special things and a lot of accolades. It was a wonderful evening.  But we also got, from the historic services, the historical group in Toronto Fire,  we got the actual motion from City Council in 1874 that set up the fire department in the City of Toronto,  and it was very special, and thank you so much for bringing that here today.  So, I can share a motion that was very successful 150 years later that basically says,  Your committee therefore recommend that a company be organised to consist of 36 men.  Now, I'll just stop there for a second because our firefighting contingent is full of men and women.  So, a very different day 150 years ago. Don't feel badly. You're here now. You weren't there then.  Whose full time and attention shall be devoted to their duties as firemen and properly drilled therein,  which will not only meet the requirements of having men and women on the spot to render the necessary assistance  in getting the engines speedily to work on all occasions of fire,  but will also be more effective for general purposes as firemen than a larger company of men  who are generally every day at work at their various kinds of employment.  I don't need to remind you that the force was an all-volunteer force of 41 people,  and with this declaration and this committee declaration, it became 36 full-time firefighters in the City of Toronto.  The difference in cost between the partially paid company and a company of 36 men would be about $12,000 per year,  which your committee have no doubt would be more than compensated by the greater efficiency of the department.  All of this is respectfully submitted, Committee Room, Toronto, July 22nd, 1874, James B. Boustead, Chair.  Anyway, that is very exciting to see that. Councillor Candoval was there. He's not here this morning.  But he said, I wonder if there were any amendments, which I thought was very funny.  But there weren't. It was a straight up, here is the motion, here is what we're doing,  here we're setting up a fire department that has done us proud for 150 years.  So to all of those who have served with courage, compassion, and service,  which is the motto of the fire services here in Toronto,  I just think we owe them all a big, deep debt of gratitude and a big thank you  for serving always with courage, compassion, and service.
[SPEAKER_14] 1694.4s - 1708.8s:  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Councillor Fletcher.  Thank you, Councillor Fletcher. Councillor Bravo.
[SPEAKER_02] 1709.2s - 1819.4s:  Thank you. As chair of Economic and Community Development Committee, I also want to build on this spirit of gratitude.  I think that looking at the video and knowing the story,  this is one of the best examples of what we can do when we pool our resources together as a society  and build a professional service that offers us the protection that we need when we need it the most  in the worst crises. Yes, it's the fires. It's also the hazards, environmental hazards.  And it's the education and support. No matter who you are or where you live,  and even if you don't have a home, the Toronto Fire Service is there to make sure people are safe.  I think when you look at the video and you know the story of this fire service,  it's a story of growing commitment from the city in building the infrastructure that's needed to provide this service.  But it's also the story of the people, of the need to constantly improve safety for them,  for firefighters, working conditions, and the continuum of care,  which I think we should be really proud of in this fire service,  which has led on the focus on trauma support and recovery.  And it's something that I feel very proud of to say and to stand before you and to congratulate you on that.  This is really also about celebrating all of the catastrophes that haven't happened  because of prevention and all the work that's done to make sure that we don't get that call in the middle of the night.  I get the call. I've had five alarm fire at Dover Court in Bloor.  The partnership and support has been unbelievable.  The St. Anne's Fire, which made global news, and the care that was shown by the fire service to that faith community  and to Davenport in particular, I think I just want to say thank you  and to add my congratulations for the future that comes with us.  Take it.
[SPEAKER_14] 1819.7s - 1823.2s:  Thank you, Councillor Bravo.  Councillor Colle.
[SPEAKER_12] 1823.4s - 1872.5s:  Yeah, I just want to say that we just had a dangerous fire this morning at Bathurst and Eglinton  where a stolen car caught on fire.  Luckily, the TTC bus driver who was run into by the stolen car  pulled the person out of the vehicle that was on fire, and that person is now in hospital.  But let's also thank the other workers who work for our transit service, police, paramedics for their work.  And especially in this case, I want to give a big shout out to that TTC driver who risked his or her life  to pull that person out of that vehicle that was in flames at Bathurst and Eglinton.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 1876.0s - 1879.7s:  Thank you.  Deputy Mayor Malik, on the item?
[SPEAKER_21] 1879.9s - 2031.3s:  Yes, on the item.  Thank you very much.  I just want to echo the thanks and the recognition to Toronto Fire Services, as we've heard  and also experienced for over 100, well, for exactly 150 years,  Toronto firefighters have stood as guardians of our city and especially in a growing city,  whether it's fires that are in towers in downtown communities like mine  or whether it's careful and delicate rescues,  they have faced countless challenges with unwavering courage and determination  that characterizes their work and their service.  And it is selfless service and an unwavering commitment to protecting our communities.  And that's what makes them true heroes.  And I'm so glad that we are able to honor them as we begin our work today at council.  And beyond firefighting, we have heard the important role that Toronto's firefighters play  as community leaders and educators and as role models.  We've seen them participate in community events and workshops, education at our public schools  and at our local community centers, sharing their knowledge and expertise  with residents of all ages to ensure that fire protection and fire prevention  are something that we are capable and prepared for as a city.  And fostering that culture of fire safety and awareness,  they're helping to create safer, more resilient and more capable communities.  I want to echo Councillor Bravo.  You know, there's so many times where, as Councillors, we have gotten that call  that something has happened in our communities that requires our attention and our support.  And each and every time, that relief that fire services has acted so quickly,  so bravely and so efficiently to ensure that the minimal amount of harm has been done  and the most amount of work has been done to protect and support communities  in that incredibly difficult and sometimes tragic circumstance.  They're always there to lend a helping hand, whether it is, you know,  disasters like we're seeing through the climate crisis  or whether it's assisting a neighbor in need, very often being the first ones on site  and making sure that folks are reassured about what will happen next.  And to our firefighters, all of the ones who are here  and who are part of the service in every corner of the city,  thank you for this commitment, thank you for your courage and your selfnesses,  thank you for being the heroes that our city needs  and thank you for our continued work together.
[SPEAKER_14] 2032.2s - 2038.2s:  Thank you.  I understand the city solicitor would like to make an introduction.
[SPEAKER_22] 2043.8s - 2058.1s:  Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.  I wanted to welcome and introduce our six new articling students  that are here with us for a year.  If you could stand up.  And I will say your names and hopefully pronounce them all correctly.
[SPEAKER_22] 2060.1s - 2074.6s:  Amanda Owusu.  Nicole Voskul.  Isha Patel.  Yelda Nury.  Camilla Conti.  And Douglas LaForest.  So they'll be working in the legal department for the next year.
[SPEAKER_14] 2081.5s - 2083.0s:  Thank you and welcome.
[SPEAKER_14] 2085.1s - 2088.9s:  May I have a motion to confirm the minutes?
[SPEAKER_14] 2091.7s - 2096.5s:  Moved by Councillor Pasternak.  So if you can read the motion, please.
[SPEAKER_14] 2098.8s - 2100.9s:  Oh, sorry, sorry.  There you go.
[SPEAKER_05] 2101.4s - 2112.9s:  That City Council confirm the minutes from the regular meeting  held on July 24th and 25th, 2024,  and the special meeting held on September 5th, 2024,  in the form supplied to the members.
[SPEAKER_14] 2113.7s - 2126.7s:  Thank you.  All those in favour, show of hands.  Opposed, if any, carried.  I will now call upon the committee chairs to introduce their reports.  The chairs can speak about the reports for up to five minutes.
[SPEAKER_14] 2129.7s - 2133.6s:  Mayor Chao, you have a motion to introduce the Executive Committee report.
[SPEAKER_11] 2133.9s - 2146.0s:  I do, and the motion is that the report from meeting 17  of the Executive Committee listed on the agenda of council  be presented for consideration.
[SPEAKER_11] 2148.1s - 2328.8s:  Madam Speaker, we have quite a long meeting,  and there were many items that went into the evening.  The first one, 17.1,  is building a universal student food program in Toronto,  something that I've been working on for many decades  since the late 80s, early 90s,  and what is in front of you is a plan,  asking for a more comprehensive plan,  but to start, we're looking to see if we could feed 8,000 kids  as of January 1st, because the winter is going to be tough.  We know that Thanksgiving is upon us,  and it will be a tough year for Daily Bread Food Bank  because the needs have increased,  because the rent is so high,  and people even working with several jobs  are having a hard time making ends meet,  which means that right now, 10.15, 10.13,  there are children in schools across Toronto  that may not be able to focus because they are hungry.  So this program, this motion in front of us in the Executive  asked us to come back with a plan in November.  The cost and how we're going to do it.  The next item is something that we've debated quite a bit,  which is the electric ferries.  You have seen different discussion  about whether our ferry is safe.  Of course, it is safe.  There was a presentation at the Executive  about our ferry services,  and that because we have ordered the electric ferries,  we want to make sure that there is the dock  that could accommodate these new ferries,  plus there would be more people able to be on these ferries,  so the dock and the whole area needs some kind of change.  The next item, Madam Speaker,  is one that I believe you are very, very interested in  because last year the rollout of the VHT  causes a lot of anguish.  A lot of seniors were scared.  Those that cannot speak English didn't know what to do.  They were crying on the phone.  They were lined up at City Hall  and all the centres trying to figure out  because 160,000 homeowners were receiving a note  to say that their tax had gone up dramatically,  which scared them, and it was unnecessary.  It was a big mistake.  So this year, in this report,  it's a redesign of the entire program,
[SPEAKER_11] 2331.4s - 2484.3s:  and there's a lot of details in it,  and I think there will be a presentation  for members of council so that you can become familiar with it  because it's quite different than last year.  It's a lot easier to apply.  There will be a lot more communication,  multilingual communication,  and perhaps some members of council  will have some suggestions to improve it even further.  Well, that item is going to be on,  and I do know that the city staff have worked very hard,  and I believe they visited about two-thirds  of members of council in coming up with this plan.  So those of you that have not had the time to visit,  to get a briefing, you will see it today.  So put your thinking cap on.  How do you think this can be improved  and let the city staff know?  Because it is a very important initiative  that we've done for several years.  Judging from the folks from Billy Bishop Airport,  welcome to council chamber.  We will be discussing that item  on the runway and safety areas  and on how we could make sure the passengers are safe  and continue to support the airport.  That item, I believe, will have a lot of discussion  because there are different options out there,  and then the questions about costs  and financing, et cetera.  So it's sort of complex,  and I believe the city staff can certainly answer  several questions, whether it's option one, two, or three,  and the financing and the tripartite agreement, et cetera.  I know I'm running out of time.  Just one other item that's really important  because Councillor Moyes has been really pushing  on the St. Lawrence Centre.  Can we afford it?  Will we be able to go ahead?  That item is also on.  And there are different...  One item that you might be interested, Madam Speaker,  is that the water capital budget,  2024 budget and the capital budget adjustment,  because that is where the funds comes from  on flood mitigation.  So a very heavy agenda that is in front of us  and lots to discuss.
[SPEAKER_14] 2484.8s - 2485.9s:  Thank you.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 2494.6s - 2499.1s:  Councillor Moyes, you have a motion  to introduce the Board of Health report.
[SPEAKER_08] 2500.0s - 2640.6s:  Yes, I do.  That the report for meeting 16 of the Board of Health  listed on the agenda of council be presented for consideration.  Last month, the Board of Health returned to session  with a full agenda of items pertinent to the health  and well-being of our city.  Top of our minds with the beginning of the school year  was the student nutrition program.  Today, at the Board's request,  we have received a report from the Medical Office of Health  outlining a phased approach to realizing  a universal student nutrition program,  an expansion for which there is critical need.  Also pressing has been response to the provincial announcement  of changes to the regulation of safe consumption sites  and $378 million in funding for new homeless  and addiction recovery treatment known as heart hubs.  Following this announcement,  Toronto Public Health was notified by the province  of the supervised consumption services at 277 Victoria Street  will cease by March 31, 2025.  As we learn more about what the new regulations mean  for sites across the city,  we have been working to determine the path forward  to ensure that people are able to receive  the full continuum of care and services that they need.  At our last meeting,  the board requested that the province continue to fund  all currently operating supervised consumption services  and consumption and treatment services sites  beyond March 31, 2025,  and all supervised consumption services to be housed  at the new heart hubs.  Finally, as the year begins to draw to a close,  so does our time with Dr. de Villa  as our Medical Office of Health.  Preparations for her departure continue  as the Medical Officer of Health and Hiring Committee  has conducted preliminary interviews  with a number of highly qualified candidates  from across the country.  We will be ready to appoint  a new Medical Officer of Health  at our November board meeting  before seeking council approval in December.  Thank you, Madam Speaker.
[SPEAKER_14] 2641.3s - 2642.7s:  Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 2648.8s - 2653.8s:  Councillor Chang, you have a motion  to introduce a Civic Appointments Committee report.
[SPEAKER_29] 2654.5s - 2701.0s:  Yes.  I would like to move that the report for meeting 18  of the Civic Appointments Committee  listed on the agenda of council be presented for consideration.  I just want to encourage my councillor colleagues  to promote our many, many boards  where people can participate.  We want people to know that their voices matter,  and it's a very meaningful way.  Sometimes we are wrestling at Civic Appointments  because we're not sure that we're getting  the diverse pool that we wish we could have,  and so the website that you can direct everyone to  is toronto.ca backslash shapeyourcity.  I hope that you can include it in your newsletters,  and let's make our boards and committees  representative of the diversity of our city.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 2701.8s - 2703.1s:  Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 2709.5s - 2715.5s:  Councillor Bravo, you have a motion  to introduce the Economic  and Community Development Committee report.
[SPEAKER_02] 2716.0s - 2777.3s:  I do. Thank you, Speaker.  I move that the report for meeting 15  of the Economic and Community Development Committee  listed on the agenda of council  be presented for consideration.  I just want to speak briefly  to some of the highlights of our 15th meeting.  We appointed the first youth poet laureate,  Shahada Jack, to great celebration  in the community and among organizations  representing youth.  We heard about the expansion  of the diversity fellows program,  an update of the program,  which will include vital Indigenous youth fellow program  that's been thoughtfully and carefully crafted  by staff in consultation with community.  And we heard the report  of the Los Angeles mission,  which was highly successful  in highlighting the stability  of our film industry in Toronto,  the concierge services that are offered  to the industry, and the quality  of our crews and our workers,  our workforce here in Toronto.  Thank you, Speaker.
[SPEAKER_14] 2778.6s - 2779.5s:  Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 2786.2s - 2790.7s:  Councillor Ainslie, you have a motion  to introduce General Government Committee report.
[SPEAKER_20] 2790.7s - 2806.7s:  Good morning.  Madam Speaker, that the report for meeting number 16  of the General Government Committee  listed on the agenda of council  be presented for consideration.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 2814.5s - 2819.7s:  Councillor McKelvie,  you have a motion to introduce  Infrastructure and Environment Committee report.
[SPEAKER_03] 2820.6s - 2884.3s:  Thank you, Madam Speaker,  that the report for meeting 16  of the Infrastructure and Environment Committee  listed on the agenda of council  be presented for consideration.  There are some great topics on there.  Everybody loves congestion, right?  So there's a report on that,  and everybody loves construction.  There's a report on that, too.  And we all love EV chargers,  and there's a report on that.  So I do ask that  you do try to advance  Circulate Your Motion so that we can move  efficiently through the  infrastructure items and also have  staff review those from a  technical standpoint.  I will say on congestion,  the report is exceptionally  and it was very well prepared  by city staff. And importantly,  it doesn't just talk about the new recommendations,  the new things they're adding, but there are  tables that are in there that describe all  the actions that are underway.  And there will be soon a dashboard  that is launched. So I think it's important  that we remember that while we're only voting on  a few motions today  related to congestion, there is a very large  body of work around that. So please also  have a look at that as you prepare your motions.
[SPEAKER_14] 2884.6s - 2889.2s:  Thank you. Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 2897.9s - 2901.8s:  Councillor Perks, you have a motion  to introduce the Planning and Housing Committee  report.
[SPEAKER_04] 2903.1s - 2920.4s:  Thank you, Speaker.  Looking for my motion here.  There it is. I move that the report  from meeting 15 of the Planning and Housing Committee  listed on the agenda of council be presented  for consideration. And given  that it was one of our shorter meetings,  this is one of the shorter speeches to introduce an item.
[SPEAKER_14] 2923.1s - 2924.1s:  Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 2930.1s - 2937.6s:  Councillor Holyday,  you have a motion  to introduce the Etobicoke York  Community Council report.

[SPEAKER_14] 3031.1s - 3039.1s:  May I have a motion  to introduce a new business from  the mayor and city officials  moved by Councillor Crisanti.  I can read the motion.
[SPEAKER_14] 3044.7s - 3046.3s:  There you go. Thank you,
[SPEAKER_09] 3046.4s - 3054.5s:  Speaker, and good morning. That the new business  from the mayor and city officials  listed on the agenda of council be presented  for consideration. Thank
[SPEAKER_14] 3054.5s - 3092.6s:  you. All those  in favour, show of hands,  posed, if any, carried.  Are there any declarations of interest  at this time? Please indicate the item  number and the nature of the interest and  remember that you must also file  a written declaration of your interest  with the city clerk. I don't see  any. I will now call  for petitions. Are there any petitions  at this time? Okay.  Members, I will now review  the order paper
[SPEAKER_14] 3097.8s - 3201.8s:  and  when we review the order paper, once  the order paper has been approved by council, any  change, we need a two-thirds vote.  The city clerk has posted today's order paper  online with the agenda item  RM 22.7  review with the order paper.  If council adopts any amendments  to the order paper, they will also  be posted with this item.  We have one deferred item before us  today, EC 14.11  and the mayor has  designated item EX 17.5  on Billy Bishop Toronto  City Airport runway  and safety areas as their first  key matter and first item of  business today. The mayor  has designated EX 17.1  building a universal student  food program in Toronto as their  second key matter as first  item of business tomorrow.  The notice to motion run through  is scheduled for 2 p.m. tomorrow  only if the mayor's key matters are  completed.  Members, there are some related matters on the  agenda that I propose be considered  together if they are held.  Items IE 16.2  and IE 16.4  relating to infrastructure  program coordination and congestion  management. The city  clerk has noted  the items that members wish to hold and  I will now go through the items to take  additional member holds. I will  review the order paper one section  at a time. The clerk will open  the speakers list in CMP and  you can place your name on the list.  When I recognize you, state the item or  items you wish to hold and I will go  through the agenda one section at a  time. Okay, we'll  start with  executive committee,

[SPEAKER_08] 3587.3s - 3593.6s:  I can teach you.  16.4.  16.5.  And 16.13.
[SPEAKER_14] 3594.7s - 3600.1s:  Yes, that's here without a recommendation.  16.13.  That's correct. Right, thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 3603.8s - 3605.6s:  Councillor  Holliday?

[SPEAKER_14] 3621.3s - 3622.7s:  So you're going to hold the item down?
[SPEAKER_17] 3622.8s - 3624.5s:  I will hold the item, thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 3626.0s - 3627.7s:  Okay, and
[SPEAKER_14] 3634.3s - 3635.4s:  new business.
[SPEAKER_14] 3640.4s - 3641.3s:  Councillor Perks?
[SPEAKER_04] 3642.3s - 3683.9s:  Yes, Speaker.  I had held CC  22.7,  amending item  2024 PH  14.1 in response  to Bill 97 Proclamation,  Employment Area  Land Use Permissions.  I'm happy to release it.  Just for members, this is a technical thing.  Our current  Official Plan permissions  reflect  old legislation, and what this item  does is bring our  employment land permissions into conformity  with the new legislation.  And this is just a minor  wording change that staff had to make  to make all of that go through.
[SPEAKER_14] 3686.0s - 3687.3s:  Okay, so Councillor Perks...
[SPEAKER_04] 3687.3s - 3688.4s:  CC 22.7.
[SPEAKER_14] 3688.6s - 3702.3s:  Councillor Perks wants to release CC  22.7, new business.  Okay, all in favour?  Opposed, if any, carried.  Thank you.  Councillor Moyes, under  the new business.
[SPEAKER_08] 3703.2s - 3711.0s:  I'd like to hold CC  22.12,  33 Maitland Street,  and 37 Maitland Street.
[SPEAKER_14] 3712.0s - 3722.9s:  Okay, thank you.  Are there any further holds on new  business?  Okay.  Thank you.  We will now
[SPEAKER_14] 3728.5s - 3745.9s:  consider  our request to make items  urgent and time specific.  You can put your name on the screen,  please. The clerk will open the  speaker's list in CMP, and you can  place your name on the list.  Councillor McKelvie.  Just one sec. There.  Councillor McKelvie.
[SPEAKER_03] 3746.5s - 3757.8s:  Thank you. I'd like to  debate 16.2 on construction  and 16.4 on congestion together.  Those items were held and have it as  the first item after the mayor's  key first item.
[SPEAKER_14] 3759.1s - 3765.2s:  Okay.  All in favour?  Carried.  Mayor Chao.
[SPEAKER_11] 3767.0s - 3783.9s:  It's  I'm asking for  15 minutes  before 12.30.  We adjourned slightly earlier because  Councillor Pasternak has a  Rosh Hashanah  celebration upstairs,  I believe.
[SPEAKER_14] 3784.9s - 3793.6s:  So the mayor is  recommending that we recess at 12.15  today. All in favour?  Carried. Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10] 3808.7s - 3822.5s:  In a second.  I've been unable to get on. IT is  here now to assist. I'd like to  make time specific EX  17.17 update on  the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts  Redevelopment Project. Okay, I don't think they
[SPEAKER_14] 3822.5s - 3826.0s:  can hear you. Can you speak into the mic?  Oh, thank you, speaker.
[SPEAKER_10] 3826.5s - 3838.3s:  Time specific EX 17.17  update on the St. Lawrence  Centre for the Arts Redevelopment  Project. And that  I'd like to have that after  the members' motions tomorrow afternoon,
[SPEAKER_14] 3838.7s - 3881.6s:  please. Thank you.  All in favour?  Carried. Okay, thank  you.
[SPEAKER_14] 3887.4s - 3994.2s:  All those in favour of adopting  the balance of the order paper as amended  and all items not held,  please raise your hands. All in favour?  Show of hands. Opposed?  If any. Carried.  Members, I want to remind you that regardless  of whether you are attending today's meeting by video  conference or in person, you will continue  to submit and approve your motions  in advance. The clerk's  staff are available to assist you with  motions. If you do not have your  motion ready, I will not recognize  you. I'm also reminding members  that you must state your motion first before  you speak to it. Members,  if you have an urgent motion without notice  you wish to bring forward at this meeting  and your seconder must submit  it by email to the clerk's staff.  Your motion must also clearly state  the reason for urgency.  Staff will prepare the necessary  procedure motion for my review along  with your motion. I will  review all motions without notice  carefully. I may ask you to provide more  information about the urgency of your motion  and why it can't be  rooted through normal committee channels.  This will inform my decision  on whether to consent to your motion and  in turn, council's decision  about whether to add your motion to the  agenda. The purpose of your motion  and your reason for urgency must be  made very clear. I will  advise council after each recess  which motions I have agreed  on that are urgent that need a motion  to add to the agenda. It will  require 18 votes to add a motion  without notice to the agenda during  the meeting. Motions added  to the agenda in this way  are not subject to a vote to waive  referral to a committee or agency.  We will now go to the mayor's  key item which is EX  17.5.
[SPEAKER_14] 3996.8s - 4005.9s:  So on 17.5  which is the Billy Bishop Toronto  City Airport.  So do we have any questions to staff  if you do?
[SPEAKER_10] 4006.2s - 4053.1s:  Councillor Fletcher. We're having this issue  again like we had last time.  Pardon? I've said I think we're  having this issue again  where there's not everybody here  but we don't know who's online.  So that  public doesn't know.  I don't know. That's a bit odd.  I think we used to have that  because  they're on YouTube and they see  that but we don't see it. So I've  only got two devices. I don't know how to  set up the YouTube as well. I don't think I should  have three. So I don't know what  the issue is. We used to have that  on our screens and understand who  was here and who was. So I just  find that a bit  off putting it up. Troubling.  Thank you.  Is there some way to deal with that?  I'm asking how we're dealing with that.
[SPEAKER_14] 4053.4s - 4060.1s:  Okay. So we'll check the staff  because can you actually  tell me who's on the screen because I don't see anything.
[SPEAKER_10] 4060.2s - 4062.6s:  You can't tell either?  Oh, gee.
[SPEAKER_14] 4067.0s - 4094.6s:  Okay. So let the staff  work on that for a while, Councillor Fletcher.  Okay. Thank you.  Okay. Thank you.  Well, before we go to the  mayor's first key item for questions,  it is  past 1030.  And Councillor Bravo, you wish  to make an  introduction on the Davenport Perth  Community Neighbourhood and Community  Health Centre. Councillor Bravo.
[SPEAKER_02] 4095.8s - 4135.2s:  Thank you so much, speaker.  I want to draw council's attention  to the presence with us today  of the Participatory  Democracy Group,  a committee that I've been meeting with  at Davenport Perth Neighborhood Centre.  And to recognize, please  stand up.  To recognize that there's more than four  decades here of local community  leadership, volunteering,  participation,  trying to motivate  residents to become more  active in democracy.  And so it's been a real privilege  for me to work with all of you and to learn  from you. Just want to welcome you  there observing council today. Welcome.
[SPEAKER_14] 4141.0s - 4142.4s:  Thank you. Welcome.
[SPEAKER_14] 4147.7s - 4154.5s:  So we'll go to  EX 17.5.  And mayor,  do you know if your students are in?
[SPEAKER_11] 4162.0s - 4163.8s:  The staff has a presentation on
[SPEAKER_14] 4163.8s - 4172.3s:  this item. Oh, okay.  But do you know  if the grade five students are  here that you're going to introduce?
[SPEAKER_11] 4172.7s - 4173.9s:  No? I don't see them yet.
[SPEAKER_14] 4173.9s - 4186.3s:  Okay. We'll wait until they come and then  we'll acknowledge the students. Hasn't  arrived yet. Okay. So  I believe that the staff has the  presentation on this item,  which is EX 17.5.
[SPEAKER_24] 4191.4s - 4259.8s:  Good morning, members  of council. My name is David Stonehouse  and I am the director of the city's waterfront  secretariat. Before I  begin, I just want to acknowledge  that there are staff here from Ports Toronto  and from Transport Canada.  Thank you to them for coming  today. Just by way  of preamble, staff  felt that it was important to  emphasize that this report,  this decision, is not about closing the  Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport.  This report is about how best to  achieve compliance with a new federal  aviation safety requirement,  runway and  safety areas. In a  tight time frame, design  and construction must be advanced  rapidly for Ports Toronto  to meet Transport Canada's July  12, 2027  deadline. And  longer term, this report  and this decision is about the need for  a broader discussion about the future  of the airport, best achieved  through an airport  master plan update  that would be led by Ports Toronto.
[SPEAKER_24] 4262.6s - 4367.9s:  In terms of the new regulations,  there is a new federal  airport safety requirement that  must be met at all of Canada's  airports for runway  and safety areas. The  intention of these runway  and safety areas is to reduce the  severity of damage to  aircraft, an aircraft if  it overshoots or overruns  a runway. Transport  Canada has identified three  ways that airports can meet runway and  safety area requirements.  First, to prepare natural compacted  open areas at the  ends of a runway. Second,  to install an engineered material,  an engineered  material arresting system, also called  EMAS, designed to  decelerate an aircraft.  And third, shorten a runway's declared  distance, so to shorten a runway.  RISA compliance is the responsibility  of airports. However,  approvals from others may  be required. So how is the  City of Toronto involved?  The Billy Bishop Airport is governed by a  tripartite agreement between Ports Toronto,  the City of Toronto and Transport  Canada. The agreement was  originally signed in 1983.  It serves as both a lease  and an operating agreement. And it is  important to point out that the  airport was operating prior  to 1983. It actually has a  history that goes back to  World War II.  Any tripartite agreement  changes would require three agreement  signatories to agree.  At Toronto Island Airport,  runway and safety area options  would require additional landmass through Lake  Fill, requiring a change to the  tripartite agreement,  and a City Council decision.
[SPEAKER_24] 4373.9s - 4432.7s:  Ports Toronto is conducting an environmental  assessment to evaluate three options for  runway and safety areas  implementation that would prepare natural  compacted open areas.  And you'll hear more about these in a minute.  Options which would have  shortened the runway's declared distance  were not considered viable by  Ports Toronto, as they would impact  the Q400 aircraft  operations. The Q400 planes  are the planes that are used now  for commercial purposes, flown by  Porter, flown by Air Canada.  Ports Toronto has also looked at  the engineered material arresting  system. And this  also was not considered viable  by Ports Toronto, for  a number of reasons,  including it  is a rather  new technology to Canada. It hasn't  been used in Canada.  Not considered  operational  in terms of cold  climates, or at least
[SPEAKER_24] 4434.8s - 4525.7s:  challenging in terms  of cold climates, and also a  single supplier. So  the first option for  consideration, option one,  which is a minimum landmass  to meet the regulatory requirement.  And this has been estimated  by Ports Toronto at  $61 to $64 million.  And I should just do an  aside here,  and to point out  that the cost estimates  that were shared by Ports Toronto  are based on concept design only.  So they are class D  cost estimates. They are  not including financing costs,  Port Toronto project management costs,  insurance, and other related  costs. And then  there's also the issue of escalation  that everyone is feeling in the construction  world.  And so these numbers  are bound to go up as they are  refined by Ports Toronto  through the design process.  So this is option one  that  is really  the base for  the other options.  Option two  is the landmass plus  two additional taxiways,  and a relocated navigational  aid. So it's  the minimum plus a few  additional  items for  operational benefit. And at a cost  estimate of approximately  $93 to $97 million.
[SPEAKER_24] 4527.9s - 4558.6s:  Option three  is the  landmass extension,  the taxiways,  a noise wall,  a utility corridor,  and airside  roads, additional airside roads at either  end of the runway, which are beyond  the runway.  And so easier for  crossings.  The estimate on option three  is $169 million  to $175 million.  Again, construction costs only.
[SPEAKER_24] 4560.7s - 4667.1s:  This is a summary slide  which sums up the three options.  And, you know,  in general, what one sees,  the volume of lake fill goes up  with each option. The width  of landmass increases with each  option. None of these  options have an impact on the marine  exclusion zone. So the  portions of the lake, which are off limits  to boats,  for safety reasons. So none of these  options impact the marine exclusion zone.  And none of these options  extend the actual runway.  So the portion,  the runway that is used by  the Q400 planes  and other aircraft.  You can see the cost estimates  compared. And again, these cost  estimates are preliminary and subject  to change. We did some  public engagement  related to this issue. We had  a public meeting which was attended by  approximately 250 people.  And then we posted an online survey  which was,  which got about  2,900 responses just over.  And the top  considerations in reviewing the runway  and area options include  impact on environment,  health impacts, impact  on Hanlon's Point as a safe, culturally  significant queer space,  waterfront revitalization,  safety and regulatory compliance,  costs, accessibility of  the airport to the users,  economic impact  of the airport and its operations,  and then finally  transparency and public engagement and process.  And these considerations  are summed up in two reports  which are part of  the item on  the city clerk's portal.
[SPEAKER_24] 4669.8s - 4716.3s:  In terms of staff findings,  staff  recommend Ports Toronto's  natural compacted open area option  one as the most efficient option  for compliance. It provides  the lowest risk scenario to  achieving the mandated federal safety  requirements by the July 12,  2027 federal deadline.  It has a considerably lower  project cost.  It does not require additional council  consideration of official  plan compliance.  And it provides the shortest construction  timeline and smallest scope of lake fill.  A lease extension is not  recommended at this time.  Staff are of the view that  a lease extension would require a broader  public conversation through an  airport master plan update.
[SPEAKER_24] 4719.4s - 4818.4s:  Ports Toronto's environmental  assessment is not a regulatory environmental  assessment. It is not a requirement of the  federal or provincial governments.  It is, however, a requirement of the city's  official plan.  It's part of the policies that  relate to lake  filling and  other topics.  Option one is  incremental to options two and three,  meaning that options two and three can be  implemented in future phases.  In terms of the broader  conversation,  separate from the runway and safety  issue, many have noted the need  for a broader discussion about the airport  and when I say many, I mean  the operator, I mean Ports Toronto,  the businesses  that operate out of the island  airport, and then also  the community.  An airport master plan update  can provide a forum to consider the issues  holistically. The  master plan was last updated by Ports  Toronto in 2018.  Master plans are typically updated every  10 years. However, Ports Toronto  has indicated  an interest in updating it at the  five-year mark or after five years.  And they've  talked publicly about that  in  recent months. An effective  framework is required to facilitate  a robust public and stakeholder engagement  process, and this is about  the third recommendation.  In order to allow for a thoughtful  consideration of the issues involved,  many of which are quite technical in nature  and require some amount of background  study, and to provide transparency  and accountability in  decision-making.
[SPEAKER_24] 4821.5s - 4898.6s:  These are the recommendations  summarized.  So the recommendations would  authorize staff to  execute the tripartite agreement  change to provide for RISA option one,  the lake filling and the landmass  extension, conditions related  to the above,  and then finally  staff would participate in discussions  with Ports Toronto and Transport Canada on  a process to update the  2018 airport master plan  in advance of the expiry  of the tripartite agreement  and report to the executive committee in Q2  of next year with a framework to guide  this process, including funding  requirements. In terms  of next steps, Ports Toronto  has noted that City Council decisions  that would enable runway and safety  areas compliance are needed in late  November of 2024,  specifically November the 29th,  to provide enough  time so that construction of the new  of the new runway ends can  be completed by Transport Canada's  July the 12th, 2027  compliance deadline.  Ports Toronto will identify its preferred  approach to compliance, recognizing  City Council's decision,  and the City, Ports Toronto  and Transport Canada will finalize and  execute an updated  tripartite agreement.
[SPEAKER_14] 4910.2s - 4916.2s:  Thank you. Okay, well  now I'll go to questions.  Councillor
[SPEAKER_14] 5014.0s - 5016.1s:  point of order. Councillor Holliday.
[SPEAKER_17] 5016.9s - 5042.5s:  Thank you, Speaker. Mr.  Stonehouse acknowledged that Ports Toronto  is in the room.  I would like the opportunity to ask them questions.  I understand that  I have to suggest a procedure  in order to do that. I think the clerk  advised that we have to go into Committee  of the Whole. I don't think that  means that we go into closed session  just to Committee of the Whole,  but that would allow members the opportunity  to ask that agency questions.
[SPEAKER_14] 5047.7s - 5055.1s:  the question is  if,  just a second Councillor Fletcher, we go  in camera, is that what you
[SPEAKER_17] 5055.1s - 5073.6s:  recommending? No, we go into Committee  of the Whole. I know it's unusual, but the clerk  advised me that we have to do this,  and that is because  we need to do that in order to  ask Ports Toronto  questions.  Otherwise I can't.  It's my understanding, unless you want to allow it.
[SPEAKER_10] 5073.7s - 5103.7s:  Okay, I'll have to clarify that.  Councillor Fletcher.  I'd like to clarify that  because I've asked to go into Committee of the Whole  previously and been told we can't  and only be in  camera. So this  would be a new great  thing where we can go into Committee of the  Whole at any time before  we decide to do that. So I'd really like  to be careful with this ruling  because, although  I think that's fine,  I can't wait for that.
[SPEAKER_14] 5104.5s - 5106.1s:  Thank you. Councillor Perks.
[SPEAKER_04] 5107.9s - 5137.1s:  Thank you. I believe  the procedures bylaw  creates an opportunity for council  to receive advice from clerks.  On this,  by going into  the Committee of the Whole,  we do more than simply  permit somebody else to  answer questions. We do things like  allow as many rounds  of questions as members want.  We can alter speaking times.  There's a whole series of consequences  and I'd just like to understand  what those are.
[SPEAKER_14] 5193.9s - 5206.5s:  Okay, so I'm  going to rule that out of order  because there has to be notice given  in advance and that hasn't been done.  Thank you.  Councillor McKelvie, questions?
[SPEAKER_03] 5208.6s - 5213.8s:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  So my first question is, which level  of government is responsible for aviation?
[SPEAKER_24] 5218.3s - 5221.6s:  Through the Speaker, the federal government  is responsible for aviation.
[SPEAKER_03] 5222.7s - 5223.8s:  Who is
[SPEAKER_24] 5223.8s - 5231.5s:  the regulator? Through the Speaker,  the regulator is Transport Canada,  a federal department.
[SPEAKER_03] 5233.1s - 5235.3s:  Is Ports  Toronto a federal agency?
[SPEAKER_24] 5235.8s - 5240.0s:  Through the Speaker, yes,  Ports Toronto is a federal
[SPEAKER_03] 5240.0s - 5245.7s:  agency. Why are we  recommending the preferred option  for a federal agency?
[SPEAKER_24] 5247.9s - 5290.6s:  Through the Speaker, the  City of Toronto is a  signatory to the Tri-Partite Agreement  and given  that, we have a responsibility  to make  decisions that are  aligned with the city's official plan  and staff  are of the view that  the city's  official plan requires  that certain  things be undertaken in order to  provide for leg filling.  And so the advice that we've provided  to Council through our report  is about the Tri-Partite  Agreement and our role in  approving Tri-Partite Agreement
[SPEAKER_03] 5290.6s - 5301.9s:  changes. So  is there any technical  reason for objections to  options one, two, or three?  I didn't read any in the report.
[SPEAKER_24] 5302.6s - 5322.4s:  Through the Speaker, in principle  no, although it should be pointed  out that some  of the aspects of  the options two and three,  some of the  ancillary features  would require some further  design and analysis  through a design process.
[SPEAKER_03] 5323.2s - 5329.5s:  So we  have no technical objection, but  it might be a little more difficult to work through the process  to get it done.
[SPEAKER_24] 5330.7s - 5332.2s:  Through the Speaker, in principle
[SPEAKER_03] 5332.2s - 5334.4s:  no. In principle, sorry?
[SPEAKER_24] 5334.8s - 5340.2s:  In principle, we would  not have an objection to the  components that are included in options
[SPEAKER_03] 5340.2s - 5347.1s:  two and three. Okay, so we have  no technical reason to  object to a sound wall and  noise mitigation.
[SPEAKER_24] 5348.9s - 5364.7s:  Through the Speaker, in principle no.  There are a lot of details to  support through, including  for example in the sound wall  where  how it would function,  how it would  operate, and who
[SPEAKER_03] 5364.7s - 5370.6s:  it would serve. Sure, there's some details, but  the principle of mitigating sound  is generally a good principle.
[SPEAKER_24] 5371.5s - 5373.3s:  Through the Speaker, yes it is.
[SPEAKER_03] 5373.8s - 5380.6s:  Do we have any technical  objection to breakwaters  or additional runway safety  improvements at the site?
[SPEAKER_24] 5381.2s - 5384.8s:  Through the Chair, no.  We would not, in principle, subject
[SPEAKER_03] 5384.8s - 5387.8s:  to design. Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 5389.3s - 5390.4s:  Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 5398.2s - 5398.9s:  Councillor Moyes.
[SPEAKER_08] 5399.6s - 5411.6s:  Thank you, and through you Madam Speaker.  I also have two questions.  Who is responsible for the  cost of this?  It regards to options one, two, or  three. Who incurs
[SPEAKER_24] 5411.6s - 5421.6s:  the cost? Through the Speaker  the cost would be  to Ports Toronto,  and Ports Toronto has been very transparent  about that.
[SPEAKER_24] 5424.9s - 5428.2s:  The  cost would not be  on the City of Toronto. Okay,
[SPEAKER_08] 5428.2s - 5450.6s:  that's good. And one of the  things I've heard for  the entire time I've been  living in Toronto is the  noise of the planes.  And so knowing  that that's a concern to  the people of Toronto,  why wasn't the noise mitigation  factored in in all  three options?
[SPEAKER_24] 5453.6s - 5470.1s:  Through the Speaker, I can't  speak to that.  The options  were designed by Ports  Toronto, and Ports Toronto's  technical consultants. And so the  noise wall mitigation was  included in option three, but not included  in options one or two.
[SPEAKER_08] 5471.1s - 5489.4s:  So in your public consultation, they said  there was 250 people who attended,  and you also had  2,900 people who  responded through a survey.  Did anyone talk about  the noise mitigation? Was that  a priority for any one  group of people that attended?
[SPEAKER_24] 5489.9s - 5546.0s:  Through the Speaker, noise  is a significant  topic vis-Ã -vis  the airport.  It has been a significant topic  for quite a while now. It featured  large in the  Porter  debate of  2014.  There's a subcommittee  that deals with  sound  issues that the airport  convenes, and it has  work to do  in the future.  Our view is that the sound issue  is a big issue that is best  addressed through the  airport master planning process,  so that the conversation can be about  the big picture sound-wise,  and so  that solutions can be  reviewed, or potential  solutions can be reviewed with  the general public and  airport stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_08] 5547.0s - 5551.5s:  Again, this is a huge investment  and a huge undertaking,
[SPEAKER_08] 5553.6s - 5562.3s:  and I'm still  not sure why  noise mitigation was not  in all the options.  That's really a concern to me.
[SPEAKER_24] 5562.6s - 5596.4s:  So through the speaker,  the best I can  say is that noise is a significant  issue. It deserves  a lot of air time, a lot  of consideration, even some technical  study, and that is best  addressed through the  master plan  update process. The focus of  our work in recent months has  been on recent compliance  and working with Ports  Toronto and Transport Canada in meeting  the July 12, 2027  timeline for recent compliance.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 5596.8s - 5604.7s:  Thank you. Mayor  Chau,  I believe that you want to do an  introduction at this time. I do.
[SPEAKER_11] 5605.8s - 5634.3s:  On the point of  personal privilege, Council Carole has  asked me to help her to welcome some very  special visitors to the Council  Chamber today.  Here from  Seneca Hall-Pymay School  in Don Valley North are  60 grade five  students and the teacher  Virginia Lone.  And the students are here because they're  interested in learning about municipal  government's responsibility. Let's  give them a big round of applause.
[SPEAKER_14] 5634.4s - 5647.0s:  Welcome. Welcome.
[SPEAKER_14] 5654.5s - 5656.8s:  Councillor Pasternak,  questions.
[SPEAKER_05] 5657.9s - 5719.6s:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. Through your staff,  I always thought  it was staff's responsibility to bring  us a balanced perspective  on different issues that  we face here. And I don't  really see that here. I'm looking  at a summary of the third  party public consultants  who handle the  public meeting.  And of  the nine bullet points, I see negative  phraseology  about the airport. From  number one, talking about the negative  impact of the airport.  Number two, talking about  something other than the airport.  Number six, talking about  environmental concerns.  Number eight, viability and need  for the island airport.  And number nine, communal  impact. Do you think  that this was a balanced  perspective on  those who do not want the airport  and those who think that the airport  is a vital economic  tool in our city?
[SPEAKER_24] 5721.8s - 5772.2s:  Through the speaker,  the report that you're referring to  is the,  it reflects the community  engagement that was undertaken  in what we heard at our  public meeting and what we  saw through the survey results.  And people  talked about a range of issues.  There were many people who participated  who were concerned about the airport.  There were people who participated  in the process who were  supportive of the airport.  What we've done is simply  record and report  what we heard. I think that  in terms of balance, the  document to  source is the staff report  which speaks about  the RISA compliance  as the critical milestone in  terms of the airport  continuing to operate.
[SPEAKER_05] 5773.9s - 5814.5s:  Well, even on the staff report,  the support for the airport is pretty  feeble. Now, let's look at the  lease extension, and you're asking  here not to  extend the lease.  And you need robust  public consultation. I have  a list here of dozens of  consultations over the airport.  It's rolled on the lakefront.  It's rolled in Toronto.  Keep it, close it.  At what point do we stop  the consultations and get on with it  already? I mean, it's been  debated for decades.  And you're asking for more consultation  on something that I would consider  to be decided policy.
[SPEAKER_24] 5816.5s - 5849.4s:  Through the speaker,  I would  draw your attention to recommendation  three, which does recommend  additional public and  stakeholder engagement.  Staff will take council direction  on whether  this engagement could happen  or should happen. I think it's important  to point out that there are many opinions  about the airport.  And  it will take time for staff  to hear from all of  the parties in providing  advice to council on this matter
[SPEAKER_18] 5849.4s - 5876.7s:  in the future. Speaker, I'd also  like to add that, just to be very clear,  this report is about compliance with the safety.  And the  so there isn't a broader  analysis of anything to do with the  airport outside of safety.  That is not an oversight or position.  It's simply that this report is about  compliance with RISA.  And then we've asked very clearly to provide  direction so we can come back with the process  to talk about the broader issues around  the extension of the airport.
[SPEAKER_05] 5878.5s - 5898.8s:  Well, for a report that's based  on safety, it certainly has some  cryptic words about  closing the airport.  But that being said,  are you aware that  there's over 2,000 people that  work directly on site  at the airport and there's 4,450  wider jobs connected to it?
[SPEAKER_18] 5899.8s - 5900.5s:  So through the speaker,
[SPEAKER_18] 5902.6s - 5926.9s:  again,  there are lots of people  that work at the airport. The airport is  functioning, will continue to function.  Those that are not in jeopardy.  We have to comply with safety.  That is the issue  that will compel the airport to continue  to move forward. Not anything else.  If safety is not  achieved by 2027 and these  are not done, there will be ramifications  through Transport Canada. Very clear in  their correspondence.
[SPEAKER_05] 5928.2s - 5938.2s:  You're talking as if it's a zero sum game.  As if we couldn't  extend the lease  unless we address safety. Why couldn't  we have addressed safety and extended
[SPEAKER_18] 5938.2s - 5974.4s:  the lease? So through the speaker  that is in the hands of council, you absolutely  can. We believe, as has  happened in the past with issues at the  airport, there are other alternatives to finance  this. The extension of the lease  for this, as requested by Ports  Toronto, is about financing  the project.  There are other alternatives to that. However,  it is in council's hands to extend  the lease, but recognize that that  enters into renegotiating  the terms of the lease for the  future of the airport through one  particular item, not through the broad set  of issues. But so we're clear, that  is in the hands of council and could easily be done
[SPEAKER_14] 5974.4s - 5986.2s:  today. Thank you. That was your last  question. Councillor  Burnside, questions?
[SPEAKER_19] 5987.3s - 6006.9s:  Thank you, Madam  Speaker. Through you,  so in 2021,  so three years ago, it became  apparent, decisions were made that  some decision would have to be made.  Is it normal that it would  take the city three years to  develop that report? Through
[SPEAKER_24] 6006.9s - 6048.4s:  the speaker, we  received  a first report,  a research technical study  in April of this year.  We provided comments and then  responses were  were sent back in early summer.  And then  we also learned a lot at the first  public meeting of the  environmental assessment process  in July  of 2024.  So really, our report  is,  it follows from  the information that  we needed to be able to report  that was provided to us in this  calendar year. So you felt
[SPEAKER_19] 6048.4s - 6054.4s:  that the process has moved as quickly  as it could? Through the speaker,  wherever she might be. Well,
[SPEAKER_24] 6054.5s - 6070.4s:  I mean, I  think since  through the speaker, since we  received the information that we requested,  the details on the  RISA proposals, which came  to us again in the RISA  technical study in April of this
[SPEAKER_19] 6070.4s - 6078.1s:  year. Okay, thank you.  In the report, it mentioned about  Ports Toronto requesting an extension  to the agreement.
[SPEAKER_19] 6080.1s - 6101.2s:  When  discussions began in  I would presume 2021,  early 2022,  was that request made?  Can you tell us?  I suspect that as a business, they're thinking  of amortization of whatever expense  they may have to  put on through the books.  So was that request made to extend the agreement?
[SPEAKER_24] 6102.7s - 6124.8s:  Through the chair,  yes, the request was  made. However,  it was only recently confirmed  the specific number of  years  the request was refined for  a 48-year  request. So 45 years  plus 3 years  to allow for  any... Okay, thanks.
[SPEAKER_19] 6124.8s - 6130.9s:  So the request was made through  the speaker at around the time  that everything got going?
[SPEAKER_24] 6131.9s - 6134.9s:  Through the speaker in  very general terms, not in
[SPEAKER_19] 6134.9s - 6155.5s:  specific terms. Okay, and with the  decision to  not engage  in that part of the...  to have consultations on that part  of the equation, would that  have been a staff decision or  a city council decision? To only go  forward with the  examining the runway  options?
[SPEAKER_18] 6160.1s - 6190.2s:  So through the speaker, if I understand  correctly, it's  in the hands of council.  The challenge we had is we don't have direction from  council on the broader terms of extending  the tri-quartet agreement.  So we've asked specifically to bring that  back. However, if today  other elements that aren't included in our report  council wishes to move on, including the  term, and modify  that, we would then  take that as direction  and as a signatory of the tri-quartet  agreement, you could authorize us to go and execute
[SPEAKER_19] 6190.2s - 6199.0s:  on that. Okay, so to confirm  the extension of this agreement  is solely in the hands of council and can  be part of any  motions today.
[SPEAKER_18] 6201.0s - 6215.2s:  So through the speaker, no,  it could be part of what happens  today. You could decide to provide  further direction to us. We've provided you  what we believe is direction within  scope. You could extend that today.  Okay, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_14] 6230.0s - 6231.4s:  Councillor Morley, questions?
[SPEAKER_28] 6231.9s - 6260.7s:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Through you, I have a couple of questions for  the Waterfront Secretariat, I believe.  And then one for the CFO.  I'm also just wanting to start  in on one of the major concerns  we're hearing from folks on this ongoing  discussion is  related to access for things like school buses.  My understanding is there's currently  school buses going across the runway  and I'm curious if anyone could  advise whether any of the options  before us solve for that ongoing  safety concern.
[SPEAKER_24] 6263.7s - 6289.0s:  So through the speaker, there are  school buses that use the runway  from time to time.  Particularly in the winter months when  the harbour freezes up.  And option  three would provide for a road  that would be beyond the runways  that would allow for  a safer  and an easier  access for  school bus vehicles.
[SPEAKER_28] 6289.6s - 6302.5s:  That's helpful, thank you.  I wanted to dig in a little bit more  about what we are hearing from members  of the public through the  consultations that have been underway  about what they want us to consider as  part of this work.
[SPEAKER_24] 6306.5s - 6312.0s:  So through the speaker,  what we heard  at our public meeting and what we
[SPEAKER_24] 6314.3s - 6363.9s:  saw through the survey in terms  of what's also been added to the  council debate in terms of  submissions to committee and council.  We see a range  of issues.  We have people that want to  close the airport and create  a park. We have people that  are staunch defenders  of the airport, users of the airport  and everything  in between.  And it's also really  been a challenge, quite frankly,  to keep people focused  on the RISA compliance issue  because there's always an interest  in speaking to the larger issues.  Sound and noise, for example.  Wildlife habitat, for example.  There's a range of issues  that people want to talk  about when they talk about this airport.
[SPEAKER_28] 6364.3s - 6392.0s:  It's very helpful  and reflective of my experiences in  office trying to find common ground  on very  challenging issues. So thank you for that.  My last question is for the CFO.  I'm wondering if you can tell me about  previous projects that were  similar in scale and how they  were financed and over what period of time.  I know there's been ongoing discussions  about the various options and the ability  to finance. So I was hoping you might  be able to shed some light on that.
[SPEAKER_16] 6395.6s - 6401.2s:  Through the chair,  sorry, Deputy Mayor, can you  be specific related to the island airport  itself or projects in general?
[SPEAKER_28] 6401.2s - 6429.0s:  Previous projects similar in scale  and how they were financed, I  gather there was previous capital  works required to bring the  airport up to its current standard.  I'm not sure if there's any other city  examples, but  a capital project  of this scope and scale in terms of  have we  had experience or have you seen  similar examples and  successful pathways  to financing?
[SPEAKER_16] 6429.7s - 6442.1s:  Through you Madam Speaker, unfortunately  I'm not overly familiar with how they  may have financed past projects.  You generally would look at  the ability to finance your capital  investments over a set period of time  based on your ability to pay.
[SPEAKER_28] 6443.4s - 6453.0s:  What impacts are  decisions here today going to have  on the potential ability for  the airport to finance  this project one way or the other?
[SPEAKER_16] 6454.3s - 6470.2s:  Through you Madam  Speaker,  looking at the option that's  in front of us today and the costs associated  with that,  Port Toronto would look at the revenues that they  would generate or ability to offset those costs  over the term set to be able to  repay that depending on the terms that were established.
[SPEAKER_28] 6471.5s - 6474.0s:  Very helpful. Thank you very  much. That's all Madam Speaker.
[SPEAKER_14] 6474.6s - 6484.8s:  Thank you. Councillor  Bradford, questions. Thanks Madam Speaker.
[SPEAKER_07] 6484.9s - 6493.3s:  I'll start with our CFO.  Would you agree that the remaining lease on an  asset generally impacts its  ability to access capital and financing?
[SPEAKER_16] 6496.5s - 6503.0s:  Through you Madam Speaker,  in any capital  investment you would look at your ability to  pay over the time set on the term of the loan.
[SPEAKER_07] 6503.6s - 6525.0s:  So, if you were looking  at a major infrastructure investment,  could be in the order of magnitude  over $100-200 million,  if you only had eight years left on  the lease, people would look  at your ability to pay that back within  eight years. If that was not  demonstrable, you might not have access  to the financing. That's a hypothetical  scenario, but one that people might
[SPEAKER_16] 6525.0s - 6536.9s:  look at. Through you Madam  Speaker, in any financing  we would look at two key considerations  would be the life of the asset itself  as well as the ability to  repay the financing over the term. Here's a City of Toronto
[SPEAKER_07] 6536.9s - 6553.6s:  example. If we had a lease on an office  building, as we do, and it  was expiring in two years and we wanted to  access some capital, tens of  millions of dollars to retrofit that,  would we have good odds of  accessing that capital to do that  retrofit on a two-year lease, office  building?
[SPEAKER_16] 6555.6s - 6565.7s:  Through you Madam Speaker,  in this hypothetical situation, we would  look at alternatives in terms of  financing if it was a two-year term.  We would also be looking at the alternatives
[SPEAKER_07] 6565.7s - 6603.6s:  available. Waterfront Secretariat,  Mr. Stone, I have a question for you.  Ports Toronto has written in on  this, and that letter indicated  that, quite clearly,  there is a risk to the airport  if we do not extend RISA.  Your presentation and deck here  off the top,  first slide, said this is not about  the future of the airport, but  according to that letter submitted by Ports  Toronto without the landmass extension  and a term extension of the lease  which they note specifically,  the future of Billy Bishop Airport  is at risk. That's a quote  from the correspondence. Are you  aware of this concern from Ports Toronto?
[SPEAKER_24] 6605.5s - 6620.0s:  Through the Speaker, yes, we are  aware of this concern and it  relates to  not the landmass extension  issue, but the  term of the  lease as per your previous  questions to the CFO.
[SPEAKER_07] 6620.8s - 6660.0s:  The term of the lease, which is a really  important piece here because we've not wanted to  touch that, but the letter goes on to say  quote, without an extension,  securing financing for the  RISA project simply cannot  happen. When we talk  about the viability  to implement the safety measures  as required by the federal government,  we have correspondence from Ports Toronto  that's saying that is just simply not  possible to access that capital,  to make the safety improvements, to comply with  the law in order to get this done.  They're not going to have access to financing  in capital, absent a  lease extension. So how then  is this actually not about  the future of the airport?
[SPEAKER_18] 6664.9s - 6672.4s:  Through the Speaker,  I think it's not  the only option that would be available for  financing. City Solicitor,
[SPEAKER_07] 6674.4s - 6690.6s:  would you agree that the federal  government has jurisdiction over regulating  aeronautics and the Canadian Marine  Act? Yes, of course. Okay.  And that power could in fact override  an attempt by a municipality to  frustrate or inhibit their ability  to exercise that jurisdiction.  Would that be correct?
[SPEAKER_22] 6696.3s - 6698.4s:  Sure, I think so, yes. Good question.
[SPEAKER_07] 6698.5s - 6702.7s:  One we might want to think about. Right.  Would it be possible that this could be challenged in court then?
[SPEAKER_22] 6704.7s - 6719.2s:  What could be  challenged? Sorry, the  decision whether or not to extend the lease  or the decision to... Correct.  I don't  think the city's  choice to extend  a term of a contract can be
[SPEAKER_07] 6719.2s - 6725.3s:  challenged in court. No. If that frustrates  their ability to implement within  their jurisdiction as according to those acts?
[SPEAKER_00] 6733.6s - 6751.1s:  Okay. I got to move.  So just to confirm,  the tripartite agreement does contemplate  scenarios where the  agreement no longer exists  or it needs to be terminated.  So the parties have acknowledged that  of course each party has  the right to decide whether or not the agreement
[SPEAKER_07] 6751.1s - 6760.7s:  continues. Okay. Two quick questions.  Chief Planner, under  any of the RISA options, the airport  as a use is  not in fact changing. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_23] 6761.5s - 6762.9s:  That's correct. Okay.
[SPEAKER_07] 6764.1s - 6789.4s:  I'll wrap with this.  We have a letter on file here from McCarthy,  one of the law firms here in Toronto  representing Ports Toronto. I want to quote  from that letter for your response.  The selection of a specific RISA option  not favoured by the city  staff does not classify  such RISA work as  non-essential public work simply  because other options exist that are more  preferred by city staff.  I take it you disagree with that? Last question.
[SPEAKER_23] 6790.3s - 6801.1s:  The reason options  two and three would require an official plan  is not because they're not favoured by staff  but because they involve Lakeville  that is not an essential public work.  No, that was it.
[SPEAKER_14] 6801.4s - 6806.7s:  Councillor Bradford, that was your last question.  Councillor Mantis,  questions.
[SPEAKER_01] 6808.2s - 6821.8s:  Echoing on Councillor  Bradford's question,  if the airport makes a recommendation that  we don't allow that to happen  by amending the terms  and land mass, is that standing  in the way of safety and operations?
[SPEAKER_24] 6826.3s - 6856.7s:  Through the speaker,  there are different ways  for the airport to  achieve RISA compliance.  Some  options are less desirable  certainly to Ports Toronto  and the airport community  but also to the city.  Our focus has been on  the RISA option  which has, in staff's  view, the best chance at achieving  compliance by the deadline  set by Transport Canada in 2027.
[SPEAKER_01] 6858.4s - 6876.5s:  So has Ports Toronto  been directly asking for  a process  for a duration, a long duration  and can staff outline  the chronology of their discussions  with Ports Toronto, Transport Canada  since December of last year?
[SPEAKER_24] 6880.6s - 6882.7s:  I'm sorry,  could you repeat the question?
[SPEAKER_01] 6883.4s - 6898.0s:  Sure.  Has  Ports Toronto been directly asking  for a process for more than  a year? Can the staff outline  a chronology of their discussions  with Ports Toronto and Transport Canada  since December of last year?
[SPEAKER_24] 6900.0s - 6950.1s:  Through the speaker,  yes, we have been discussing  RISA compliance  for a number of months  now. There were conversations  last fall.  There was an  executive steering committee struck  earlier this year.  But  a lot of the discussion depended  on the technical  analysis that was submitted by  Ports Toronto in April of this  year, which outlined  the RISA options from a technical perspective  and outlined  a series of  questions to consider. We provided  comment back.  We received  information back  in return, and then Ports Toronto  had its first environmental  assessment public meeting in July  of 2024.
[SPEAKER_01] 6951.0s - 6985.8s:  Through the chair, I know  that a lot of my constituents  choose to use the airport for lots of  different reasons. What I would like to  understand more from staff is  the medical access  side of the airport. At executive  committee, Hope Air  CEO talked about 3,000 plus  flight trips to Billy Bishop Airport.  They and their pilots  fly to bring patients  from other Ontario communities  needing Toronto's world-class medical care.  Can staff elaborate on the urgent  medevac activities through Orange  that take  place at the airport?
[SPEAKER_24] 6987.8s - 7044.1s:  Through the speaker,  I would distinguish between the service  provided by Orange, which is about  emergency.  If one was in a car accident,  one would be transported to a trauma  centre via  an orange helicopter  or a different kind of orange vehicle.  Hope Air,  there was a gentleman at committee  from Hope Air who  delivered a very  articulate  description of what  that organization does.  They transport  people from remote communities,  from northern communities in particular  to Toronto area hospitals  on a non-urgent basis.  For example, if people  are needing to access  chemotherapy  or surgeries or  other things that are not available  in the north or in other remote communities.  But just to
[SPEAKER_01] 7046.6s - 7058.6s:  ask the  question on  that one, by not  doing the recommendations,  do we impede on  the necessary
[SPEAKER_01] 7060.8s - 7062.1s:  procedures that are needed
[SPEAKER_24] 7062.1s - 7094.4s:  for people that live in the north?  through the speaker,  Orange uses helicopters  principally and so those  are unaffected by the runway and safety  areas, those flights.  Hope Air involves  the use of the Porter flights  and the Air Canada flights, the Porter flights  in particular. So  it would be important for that work to  continue for  RISA compliance to be  achieved so that the Q400  could continue to operate safely from
[SPEAKER_01] 7094.4s - 7102.1s:  the airport.  So for these 3,000, through you Madam Speaker,  for these 3,000 plus trips,  if we're not able to do them at the airport
[SPEAKER_14] 7102.1s - 7105.4s:  then we would need to take them to Pearson.  That was your last question.
[SPEAKER_24] 7106.7s - 7110.7s:  That is correct and that's why  staff are working towards achieving  RISA compliance.
[SPEAKER_14] 7111.3s - 7113.7s:  Thank you.  Councillor
[SPEAKER_14] 7117.6s - 7118.3s:  Myers.
[SPEAKER_14] 7121.1s - 7124.1s:  Just one second.  Councillor Myers, question.
[SPEAKER_26] 7126.3s - 7165.8s:  There you go. Thank you Speaker  and through you.  So I had some questions  on the financing piece.  So I understand  the argument that it would be difficult  to secure the financing  given that the lease only extends for 8  more years. But aren't there  other options available for this type of  financing like Canada Infrastructure  Bank? Like I'm looking on their website  and I see they finance the Thompson  Regional Airport and the  Montreal  Metropolitan Airport. So aren't  there other options than going to traditional  financing companies for this type  of deal within  the time frame?
[SPEAKER_16] 7167.6s - 7183.0s:  Through you Madam Speaker,  there are a myriad of options in terms  of how you might finance a capital project  be it how you might be able to support it  through funds you have on hand or other  financing options as you've noted  potentially through Canada Infrastructure  Bank or other government financing that might
[SPEAKER_26] 7183.0s - 7195.2s:  exist. Thank you.  And is it normal  due diligence for the City of Toronto  to sign a 40-year  lease without some sort of analysis  as to the future impacts
[SPEAKER_26] 7198.4s - 7201.7s:  or agree to an extension  of a lease for this long
[SPEAKER_18] 7201.7s - 7246.2s:  period? So through the  Madam Speaker, I think that's been  a bit of the challenge  here is that  in one sense it's more than a  financing discussion. We completely  understand the financing piece  and generally speaking, particularly around  airports, you would finance this with an  extension and a term that takes  into that account. That's how capital  investments and a lot of things happen but certainly  in the airports. The challenge with that  is, as you point out,  it then binds  a larger tripartite agreement  to a term which  we would feel is part of  a larger discussion about  extending that tripartite agreement.  So that's the conundrum that we were in  in bringing this report forward as well.
[SPEAKER_26] 7246.7s - 7264.1s:  Thank you. And just to be  clear, so we haven't done any  sort of analysis as to  what impact a 40-year lease might  have on our TransformTO  goals or our climate change  initiatives on waterfront  redevelopment. We haven't done any  sort of analysis like that.
[SPEAKER_18] 7266.1s - 7278.8s:  So through the speaker, I think it would  be fair to say that we have  in terms of an extension  to the tripartite agreement,  we have not entered into that level  of due diligence around the tripartite  agreement.
[SPEAKER_26] 7280.7s - 7299.9s:  And is it the  staff's position  that if we  that although the preference  may be for a different option,  option one still  maintains the airport as viable  for the  remainder of the lease, which is until  2033.
[SPEAKER_18] 7301.5s - 7317.5s:  Through the speaker,  the staff's position is how do we comply with  Transport Canada guidelines?  The phased options, the first  phase of that, that option one,  which can be built on in options two  and three, that option one complies  with the requirements of  Transport Canada.
[SPEAKER_26] 7318.3s - 7334.8s:  And final question,  does the staff have any sort of  timeline in mind as to when  these further options  could potentially be explored, which would  include some sort of further public  engagement, further analysis on how  this potentially fits with our other  city building initiatives?
[SPEAKER_18] 7335.8s - 7356.6s:  So through the speaker,  our recommendation is we get on that right away.  We bring you back information very early  in the new year. It won't take long  to develop the framework, and we believe  we can get into this work very quickly  and move through it swiftly to look at the  full tripartite agreement  and understand what the future  looks like in this relationship.  Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_14] 7357.6s - 7358.7s:  Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 7363.9s - 7365.5s:  Councillor Bravo, questions?
[SPEAKER_02] 7366.5s - 7404.3s:  Thank you, speaker. I want to pick up on  the question of financing  to the  Chief Financial Officer.  You were asked earlier by my colleague,  Councillor Bradford,  the importance of  the life of the asset in relation  to securing financing,  but you were a bit cut off on the  second dimension, which is  ability to repay.  And is it accurate  that that relates to  a business plan  operationally to be able to  recover  through revenue the investment  that's been made in capital?
[SPEAKER_16] 7406.1s - 7410.2s:  Through you, Madam Speaker, that's  absolutely correct. That would be a consideration  in the repayment plan.
[SPEAKER_02] 7411.0s - 7464.5s:  And I'm not sure who would ask this one,  too, but following up on that,  while  this was clearly not on the  radar, according to all  of the documents that indicate  the consultation piece, there was no question  around the lease extension, and this wasn't  flagged during that  process.  There is now, this has been brought  before us in terms of the  money that's been made here.  Do we know from  Ports Toronto what the business plan  is at this time?  Do we know how it intends  to repay  the financial investment  into the  capital pieces that are required  here? Because the 40  lease extension, to my mind, also  should involve questions  about a business plan to operate.  Is that available  at this time? Does anyone know?
[SPEAKER_24] 7467.2s - 7494.7s:  Through the speaker,  we have received  general information from Ports  Toronto about its approach  on business matters.  It would use the airport improvement  fee, for example, as a revenue  towards paying back debt.  It's talked about the borrowing that it would  do from capital markets  and other financial institutions.  We  have not seen a detailed  business plan on this matter.
[SPEAKER_02] 7495.1s - 7518.8s:  I ask, if you want to  stay on your feet, I ask this question  in part because I note  in the staff report, it says that the  airport, under the current  lease, has plenty of capacity  to expand the number of  flights, but is it accurate  that no new  airlines have expressed interest  up to now in  operating additional flights out of the  airport?
[SPEAKER_24] 7521.2s - 7559.0s:  Through  the speaker,  I can't  really verify that.  Certainly Porter has operated there  for years, or Canada's  operating.  The airport was impacted pretty  significantly through the COVID pandemic.  In fact, it closed for a time.  And flights are back to  probably 80% of pre-pandemic  levels. So I do believe  that Ports Toronto is  working with its industry  partners is  exploring new ways of  attracting additional business.  I think that that's very much  on its mind.
[SPEAKER_02] 7559.6s - 7619.6s:  So it's recovering but not at the rate that  Pearson has recovered.  So my next question  has to do with  what's been asked already.  I just want to ask a different dimension.  Councillor Myers talked about  the unusual  situation of being asked to commit  to a 40-year lease  but without  having done the studies  or the looking at  other impacts.  I would like to know, perhaps  I'm not sure who would answer that,  whether there's been  any study of the impact  of the planned  via rail high-speed connections  in the corridor  on potential  change of modality,  change people's shifting to  train travel,  which is very  convenient.  And if it cuts down time,  could be a competitor  in the corridor proposed.
[SPEAKER_18] 7620.7s - 7632.9s:  So through the speaker, again, I'll reiterate,  we have been focused on RISA compliance.  So any of those matters,  any of those thoughts, as it  relates to the airport,  have not been part of our conversations  nor part of analysis.
[SPEAKER_02] 7633.1s - 7657.4s:  Right, because what's before us is actually  just the safety requirements.  So the  final question is,  we've heard from a few people say  it's just because staff  prefer, staff want.  Can you comment on  the obligations that you have  that direct, in general,  staff analysis  when they bring stuff before this council?
[SPEAKER_14] 7658.0s - 7659.3s:  That was your last question?
[SPEAKER_18] 7659.3s - 7739.8s:  So through the speaker,  our goal is  to bring you good advice about how we can comply,  particularly when we've received information such as  the need  to address safety  concerns.  We are a signatory, we're part of a group  of people that have agreed to manage  the future of the airport  well. We take that seriously.  The challenge for us is  that some elements  of this delve into  the second part that we want to get into  and we want to have, it's not easy.  It would be much easier if this conversation  was at another time because it would  manage itself. Not for a minute  are we suggesting that Ports Toronto is  not providing good information about their challenges  from a financing perspective. They are.  The challenge for us is, where  do we go in terms of what we bring forward  to you as our governing body?  It is before you. We  can, we can  allow for an extension, as  requested and as discussed.  That is something that can happen as an  extension of our recommendations.  We feel there are options that could be  explored. However, if Ports Toronto  wishes to pursue some of the other  options that are in the report,  there would be  limited ability for  other alternatives. The larger the value  gets, it really needs to be amortized  over a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_14] 7743.0s - 7763.8s:  Thank you.  Okay, before we go  to the next question, I would  at this time,  members, please join me in  welcoming the Honorable J.  David Wake, Contemporary Commissioner  of Ontario, to the  Council Chamber. Commissioner Wake has  joined us today to observe some  of our proceedings. Welcome.
[SPEAKER_14] 7772.0s - 7773.7s:  You've picked the right day to be here.
[SPEAKER_14] 7777.4s - 7779.8s:  Okay, welcome.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 7782.0s - 7785.9s:  Councillor  Cheng, questions?
[SPEAKER_29] 7786.6s - 7794.2s:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I'm just wondering,  how long have we known about the  July 12, 2027 deadline?
[SPEAKER_24] 7798.9s - 7817.4s:  Through the Speaker,  that was confirmed  this year, and  it relates to  some statistical analysis  done by  Stats Canada to confirm that the  airport has operated  with 325,000 passengers  for two full years.
[SPEAKER_29] 7817.7s - 7822.7s:  So the deadline is  related to the capacity  of the airport?
[SPEAKER_24] 7824.0s - 7841.2s:  Through the Speaker, it's related  through the number of flights  in an airport  over a two-year period.  And if it's  a large number of flights, so  325,000 a year,  then the RISA requirements  must be complied with.
[SPEAKER_29] 7841.8s - 7860.9s:  Given that there's been a very  short runway to this,  big investment,  is there any opportunity  to request an extension of the deadline  to buy us some time  to work through a more  effective process  in negotiating a tripartite  agreement?
[SPEAKER_24] 7862.2s - 7884.8s:  Through the Speaker, we have asked  this question of Transport Canada.  Ports Toronto has asked this question  of Transport Canada.  And for safety reasons,  Transport Canada is  concerned in saying that the deadline  is not something  that is flexible.  The airport operates safely right now,  but this new
[SPEAKER_24] 7888.2s - 7893.5s:  regulation  is coming in and it must be complied with  as other airports in Canada  have complied.
[SPEAKER_29] 7894.0s - 7908.4s:  So really the best fix for this  quandary that we find  ourselves in would be  to be able to get an extension  in order to go through  a fair process in a tripartite  extension.
[SPEAKER_24] 7910.8s - 7925.1s:  Through the Speaker, I just don't think  that that scenario is realistic given  Transport Canada's  view on safety  and the extent to which  its operators, airport operators,  must comply with the safety  requirement.
[SPEAKER_29] 7925.9s - 7941.5s:  Can option one be designed with  rough-in components for option  three additional elements  to reduce the cost of  adding it later  if they don't  rough some of those components in?  Is that an option?
[SPEAKER_24] 7942.4s - 7977.4s:  Through the Speaker,  the staff view is that options two and three  are incremental to option one,  so option one  can be implemented now  and the additional components can be built  at a future date.  We do not have information on the incremental  cost of adding these  additional pieces.  There would be demobilization  and remobilization costs.  There would be escalation,  et cetera.  But we have not  had information on this, nor  has Ports Toronto  really had time to consider  that.
[SPEAKER_29] 7978.1s - 7985.5s:  What type of assurance is a city able to offer  to help with the financing  issues that Ports Toronto  is facing?
[SPEAKER_29] 7987.6s - 7992.6s:  What would help them  get the financial support  that they need?
[SPEAKER_14] 7993.0s - 7994.9s:  We'll get the City Manager to answer.
[SPEAKER_18] 7995.2s - 8011.6s:  Through the Speaker, to date  we've not had conversations about  alternative pieces.  Ports Toronto continues to  put forward what their approach would be  for the option three piece,  which is over $200 million,  and how they would finance that through an extension.
[SPEAKER_29] 8013.1s - 8027.3s:  What is  the time of  amortization of option  one? Do we have any idea  of that amount of money?  How many years would it take  for them to  amortize those costs?
[SPEAKER_18] 8033.6s - 8037.9s:  Through the Speaker, it would depend on  repayment terms. I wouldn't want to speculate  and give a time frame.
[SPEAKER_29] 8041.3s - 8063.1s:  This is the last question  I have.  Maybe, I don't know who can  answer this, but what  role does Billy Bishop play  in Toronto's tourism and economy?  Is it nice to have  or does it play a critical role?  Is there anyone who has insight  on its current role in  our city at large?
[SPEAKER_18] 8066.6s - 8105.1s:  Through the Speaker, I'll start  and then I'll ask Pat Tobin to provide  just a little bit of context.  There are numerous reports,  and it has been reported  regularly, the impact that the airport has  in many positive ways  for the community. It's not  the subject of this report, and this has come  to a stop, so that's why I wanted to begin  the answer for you, Councillor,  is this was not that kind of report.  So the absence of that type  of data and information  means nothing  other than we're focused on the compliance  with RISA. But Pat, I know there's been  a number of reports written  and generated around particularly the tourism  element of it.
[SPEAKER_15] 8105.8s - 8144.1s:  Through the Speaker to you, Councillor Chang,  the City Manager is correct.  Toronto receives 26.5  million visitors  last year, and it accounted for  some $8.4 billion  in spending. Two million  passengers came through Billy Bishop  during that time, 2023  as well, and roughly half  of those are leisure travelers.  It's a growing segment.  As my colleague noted, they still continue  to strive to reach pre-pandemic  levels, which in 2019  were 2.8 million, and they  are now at 2 million. But  Billy Bishop is a critical asset for the really  important tourism industry in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_14] 8144.8s - 8146.1s:  Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 8149.8s - 8151.4s:  Councillor Ainslie, questions?
[SPEAKER_20] 8152.0s - 8184.4s:  Thank you, through you, Madam Speaker.  So not to beat a dead horse, but I'm  still trying to understand the financing  in the slide deck. I'm trying to  understand. So we're looking  at three options. Safety seems to be  a big concern. My understanding  is we're not loaning the federal  government any money, but each  of the options in the slide deck comes with  a cost, but it's not  a cost to us. So I'm  wondering, and why is that  in this? Through you, Madam
[SPEAKER_16] 8184.4s - 8212.0s:  Speaker, each of the different options have a different  cost, and associated with that different cost  is the terms that you would require  to make repayment. So at  a lower cost value, feasibly  you could look at a repayment within the existing  agreement timelines,  depending on what the terms are, what the repayment  amounts would be, the initial  investments that would be made outside  of financing versus a larger  cost would require a longer  period of time to repay, which would be  outside of the existing agreement.
[SPEAKER_20] 8212.8s - 8230.9s:  Yeah, and so I guess I'm trying  to understand. Mr. Conforti is, like,  not to be facetious, but  why do we care about that? Like, it's the federal  government going out, getting the  loans, or they,  financing. We're not doing any of the financing.  So why is that  relevant to us today? Through you,
[SPEAKER_16] 8230.9s - 8243.8s:  Madam Speaker, the ability to secure  financing through financial institutions  would have a set term tied to it.  If that set term extends beyond  the existing agreement, there would be challenges  in being able to secure that  financing to do the work.
[SPEAKER_20] 8248.2s - 8256.1s:  So option one, two,  or three, depending on which option  we think they should be doing,  is going to make it easier for them to get long-term  financing?
[SPEAKER_16] 8257.5s - 8265.7s:  The different options, given  that each of them come with different costs, would have  different financing requirements and term  requirements associated with that financing.
[SPEAKER_20] 8266.2s - 8269.3s:  Yep. But I get all that, but  why is it relevant to us?
[SPEAKER_16] 8271.3s - 8284.3s:  So what would be  relevant to us would be the ability  to carry out the work  that's required to meet the safety requirements.  And considering that against  other considerations that may need to be had  specific to the existing
[SPEAKER_24] 8284.3s - 8306.4s:  agreement. Okay.  Alright. Through  the Speaker, I'll add that  you know,  the achievement  of RISA compliance, which requires  the financing, is  the key to  the airport continuing to operate.
[SPEAKER_20] 8306.7s - 8328.1s:  Yep. And I understand all that.  We have three options that we're being  looked at to consider.  But we keep talking about the financing  of each one, although the financing  isn't relevant.  Anything that we're doing, we're not loaning  the federal government reports, Toronto  money. We're not involved  in the financing, so I don't understand  why it keeps coming up.
[SPEAKER_20] 8330.3s - 8381.1s:  So I don't need an answer.  It's okay. So my  next question, I'm trying to understand the  public consultation process.  So I'll use my ward as  an example in eastern Toronto,  southeastern Toronto. So there was  an online survey,  Ports Toronto did two  public consultation meetings,  I understand, and then the only  one that the City of Toronto did,  and at the tail end of the period,  was in downtown  Toronto. So I'm trying to understand  why we only did one meeting  at the tail end of the consultation.  And so for  residents in Scarborough,  if they didn't do the online survey, they were expected  to go to the Anarchare Centre  somehow. I don't understand why  we wouldn't have had more consultations  across Toronto.  If this is like a city-wide  used airport.
[SPEAKER_24] 8381.3s - 8406.2s:  So through the  speaker,  the consultation  and engagement that was done by  Ports Toronto, that is being done by Ports Toronto,  is  essential because it is the project  proponent. And as the  project proponent, as the  manager of an EA process,  it is  required to do  public engagement.
[SPEAKER_24] 8408.6s - 8452.3s:  The  meeting that we had  and the survey that we organized  was about  providing an outlet,  one outlet, for  public feedback, stakeholder feedback  to inform the report  that is before you today.  In terms of the go-forward,  the framework report  that we'll come back with next year, we'll talk about  process, stakeholder  and public engagement objectives.  Staff would see  this as a city-wide issue and we would  want to cover  more geography than just  what was covered this year.  Similar to what was done in 2014  or in the lead-up to 2014  associated with the  Porter proposal.
[SPEAKER_14] 8453.9s - 8455.2s:  Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14] 8461.4s - 8463.0s:  Councillor Crisanti, questions?
[SPEAKER_09] 8464.4s - 8490.6s:  Yes, speaker.  Thank you.  So at the risk of belaboring  the question that Councillor Ainslie  asked about the  financing and so on, I think  we still need a little bit more clarification.  I'm going to go back to a comment I heard  from the city manager maybe  10 minutes ago when  I believe you said that  whichever option is chosen  that it's going to have to be amortized  over a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_09] 8493.8s - 8506.7s:  So again,  I want to just clarify, at the risk of  also sounding  like the commercial on TV, who's paying  for this? So maybe  you could just pick up on the amortization  part.
[SPEAKER_18] 8508.2s - 8533.8s:  So through the speaker, of course Toronto will be  responsible for the financing  of this. This is not a city  approach and  my comments were about some of the  more costly  options that are outlined.  It would require a much longer amortization.  If you're talking about a 200 million plus  project, there's  no pathway that myself or the  CFO could see that that would fit into a  shorter time frame.
[SPEAKER_09] 8534.7s - 8566.6s:  So the taxpayer doesn't  touch this. This is all ports  and finance through them.  And again, it's been made clear in the report  and also in the presentation.  These are concept designs.  So I think  the likelihood of the  $61 million to the  $175 million  option, that can likely  increase by, you know,  20, 30, 40 percent.  The cost could be even more  when we're ready  to put shovel in the ground.
[SPEAKER_18] 8568.0s - 8577.7s:  Through the speaker, it's  not uncommon for class D estimates  to go  up as we get the detailed designs.  Not we, but as the proponent we get the detailed
[SPEAKER_09] 8577.7s - 8585.8s:  designs. Thank you.  What is  Port's preferred approach at  this point? Do we have that clear?
[SPEAKER_18] 8587.5s - 8600.1s:  Through the speaker,  they've indicated the option three.  The full  option three  was what the request was, and that  coincided with the request for the extension  term within the
[SPEAKER_09] 8600.1s - 8658.0s:  tripartite agreement. And does it make sense?  I looked at option three, and  personally I really like it. There's some  great  additional amenities, if you want to call it  that, that are necessary, and that I think  the public would really embrace.  And when you do this kind of a  project and you're in the planning stage,  you know,  once you're into it, you're  best to roll everything out at one time.  If we piecemeal  it, the cost will continue to escalate  over time. Is there  no possibility of seriously  looking at Resa 3  and also  having some wording to the effect that  we know this airport and  how it serves Torontonians and the  CTA, and words to the effect that  yeah, the lease  will be extended. Of course  the terms and conditions have to be  discussed and debated at a different  meeting, but we could have wording  to the effect that that is something  that we would agree to.
[SPEAKER_18] 8658.9s - 8693.1s:  So through the speaker,  if council wishes to provide additional  instruction to staff to  negotiate an extension to the lease term,  great. That would then  not be open for  re-discussion as part of a larger  set of discussions.  That part of it would not be part of  our tripartite agreement discussion.  So the term would be set and we'd be  looking at other things within the  tripartite agreement, of which there's lots  that we would then do through the  longer process. But just to be clear,  there would be no ability to go back  on the term because that would then  coincide with the financing options.
[SPEAKER_09] 8693.5s - 8734.8s:  It sounds like we're digging our heels on  option one.  And why is it that we're  doing that? Why not leave those  options to them? They're  running it. They've made  some, you know, they've provided two  other sensible options. Option  three being, from what I see, the  most sensible because it deals  with other necessary things that need  to happen roughly in and around the  same time. Sound barriers,  underground utilities, and  so on. Why not  give them the flexibility, let them  operate in the way they need to, when they go for  financing, go for everything they  need, and we support it along the  way. And the three partners would support  it along the way. So through the
[SPEAKER_18] 8734.8s - 8768.1s:  speaker, our recommendations are based  on where we feel least risk, given  the time frame exists. And as  has been mentioned by our chief  planner, there are additional processes,  we believe, for options two and three from  a planning perspective. That adds time.  The second piece is because we're not  recommending an extension of the lease agreement  because we think the council really needs to give us direction  on the extension of the  tripartite agreement. We also  wanted to say that we believe  there is an option that can work  without the extension and still have  full compliance with the safety  requirements. Thank you, speaker.
[SPEAKER_14] 8768.6s - 8776.5s:  Thank you. Councillor Sacks,
[SPEAKER_13] 8776.6s - 8791.6s:  questions?  Thank you, Madam Speaker.  For the city  manager, does recommendation  three, in your view,  imply approval today  for extending the operation of the airport  after 2033?
[SPEAKER_18] 8793.6s - 8795.7s:  So through the speaker,
[SPEAKER_18] 8797.7s - 8824.6s:  it simply  says that we need to talk  about the  tripartite  agreement. And so  all of those discussions would  come back here. And so if there  is, if  the conclusion of those  discussions was not to the satisfaction  of council, that would lead us to a different  discussion. But we would be entering into  it to look at how we would  modernize and extend the tripartite
[SPEAKER_13] 8824.6s - 8828.9s:  agreement. Okay. But my question  is, does the current recommendation
[SPEAKER_13] 8832.1s - 8842.8s:  imply,  give the airport  comfort, that we will  allow them to operate after  2033? Is that  in the existing recommendation or
[SPEAKER_18] 8842.8s - 8848.3s:  not? Through the speaker,  that would be our premise  going into those negotiations,
[SPEAKER_13] 8848.9s - 8860.5s:  yes. Okay.  So in your view, recommendation three  does imply that  we will, assuming we can  reach an agreement, allow  the airport to operate after 2033?
[SPEAKER_18] 8861.1s - 8862.0s:  Through the speaker, correct.
[SPEAKER_13] 8862.4s - 8868.3s:  And in your  view, have we consulted  the public on that question?
[SPEAKER_18] 8870.6s - 8895.7s:  Through the  speaker,  not in the immediate term, no.  I think, and I'm  careful here because I don't have the full history,  but I think over the course of history, those  questions have been asked, but we have not  asked any of those questions because this  has been simply about complying with a safety  standard. In the  absence of the requirement to comply with  this, would this  discussion even be happening at this stage? I don't
[SPEAKER_13] 8895.7s - 8919.9s:  know. Right. So  we haven't consulted the public  explicitly on it.  And we haven't consulted the public explicitly  on what types  of aviation  we should allow at this location,  correct? We haven't discussed  whether we should allow billionaire private planes.  We haven't discussed the  types of choices that could be held.  We haven't had that conversation yet.
[SPEAKER_18] 8920.2s - 8921.3s:  Through the speaker, no, we have not.
[SPEAKER_13] 8921.8s - 8939.7s:  And in particular, the agreement  right now calls for this to be a general  aviation airport,  private planes,  plus some limited commercial.  We haven't discussed with the public whether  we want to have continuing  private planes at this airport  burning leaded gas, right?
[SPEAKER_18] 8940.4s - 8943.9s:  Through the speaker, no, those  would be the kinds of conversations that would
[SPEAKER_13] 8943.9s - 8955.9s:  happen. Right. But right now,  the private planes at this location  are burning  leaded fuel,  lead being a neurotoxin with lifelong  impacts on the health of people exposed to
[SPEAKER_24] 8955.9s - 8960.4s:  it, right? Through the  speaker, that is my understanding.
[SPEAKER_13] 8962.0s - 8972.5s:  And lead  is an element. It never disappears.  It doesn't just  damage the people it falls on.  It damages people who are exposed to it  year after year after year, correct?
[SPEAKER_18] 8973.3s - 8982.6s:  Through the speaker, correct.  And one of the real principles  that we would enter into this conversation is the  environmental concerns in the broadest  sense of the environmental concerns for the airport
[SPEAKER_13] 8982.6s - 8990.9s:  for sure. Right. And that includes the air  quality concerns, which have been well  documented and have serious,  can have serious adverse effects on people.
[SPEAKER_18] 8991.8s - 9001.0s:  Through the speaker, correct.  This would be a chance to modernize  our agreement and really bring it in  line with some of the other things that we're trying to accomplish  as a city. Okay. So
[SPEAKER_13] 9001.0s - 9011.6s:  what would you have to  do before you can bring to us  an explicit recommendation  on whether  we should continue to have an airport  on these lands?
[SPEAKER_18] 9012.4s - 9036.7s:  Through the speaker, we've recommended a  two-phase approach to that. One is to bring you back  the framework for the discussion, to talk about  the areas that we will be exploring,  both to do some technical analysis  as you suggested in a couple of areas, and then  the second piece is the time frame for the discussions  with the parties  that would be involved in it. So  the first piece to come back is the framework  for those discussions, and then we would enter  into that process and bring back the
[SPEAKER_13] 9036.7s - 9054.7s:  results. Right. Mr. Johnson,  doesn't that expose the airport,  the airlines, the pilots,  the residents, everyone  who has to make long-term decisions  to a prolonged period of uncertainty  as to the future  of the airport? Is it going to be airport? Is it  going to be parks? Is it going to be something else?
[SPEAKER_18] 9056.2s - 9082.7s:  So through the speaker,  I think I've answered what the premise entering into  it is. So the  is it a wide-open question? It's not a green field  exercise. We're looking to modernize an agreement.  The second piece is this is not something that  needs to take years and years to complete.  We can get on it and do this work  in fairly short order. I do believe,  however, though, it does require some analysis.  It does require some due diligence. It does  require some engagement, and  that can't happen in days and weeks. It's going to  take some months to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_14] 9083.3s - 9093.1s:  Thank you. That's it. That was your last  question. Councillor  Candoval.  Questions.
[SPEAKER_27] 9094.0s - 9123.2s:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, and through you  to pick up on  some of the earlier questions about  public consultation  through you to staff.  To start broadly, does this  does staff view this issue  as a city-wide issue?  Through the speaker, yes.  Thank you. My  understanding is the notice for  public consultation was  issued eight days prior to the meeting.  Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_18] 9125.0s - 9134.0s:  So through the speaker, sorry  Councillor, I took your previous question to talk  about engagement in the future.  David will have to answer the question about the engagement  we just went through.
[SPEAKER_24] 9134.0s - 9150.4s:  So through the speaker, yes,  the notice was  just eight days.  That sounds right. Not ideal.  Staff admit that.  Not consistent with  City of Toronto  best practices in terms of stakeholder
[SPEAKER_27] 9150.4s - 9172.3s:  and community engagement. And I understand  the location of the  consultation was a challenge  for folks who may not live  in the vicinity.  Was that  were those challenges  were staff aware that the location  would pose  a challenge to the  residents from across the city?
[SPEAKER_24] 9174.2s - 9194.2s:  Through the speaker,  we needed to find  a room that was  large enough and  available and  so that's where we ended up at  Exhibition Place.  I think in the future we would want to  have meetings  in other parts of the city and then also
[SPEAKER_27] 9194.2s - 9204.7s:  online. Fair enough.  Was there any attempt made by staff  to live stream the meeting for  folks who would be unavailable  or unable to attend  in person?
[SPEAKER_24] 9206.0s - 9211.8s:  Through the speaker, no, we  settled on an in person meeting only  with the survey to
[SPEAKER_27] 9211.8s - 9219.6s:  To clarify for the public, we do  have the technology to live  stream a meeting as we do  with other public consultations?
[SPEAKER_24] 9219.6s - 9220.6s:  That is correct.
[SPEAKER_27] 9221.2s - 9237.2s:  Were there any attempts to  coordinate a virtual  public consultation  in light of the difficulties  of  live streaming it? Were there  attempts to create an online  Zoom or WebEx option?
[SPEAKER_24] 9238.7s - 9241.3s:  Through the speaker, we did not  offer that option.
[SPEAKER_27] 9246.0s - 9273.7s:  With many public consultations  and I see this locally  with city staff  from PFR  seeking community  feedback on park  revitalization, paid  ads are placed in social media  for surveys.  Was the  survey conducted  by staff,  did staff utilize any paid  promotion?
[SPEAKER_24] 9276.4s - 9284.2s:  Through the speaker, we did  make use of City of Toronto social media  but I do not believe  that we placed ads.
[SPEAKER_27] 9285.1s - 9304.1s:  Do you think if we're  placing paid ads on  park feedback,  do you think for  an issue of significant impact  that is truly city  wide,  would it be fair to say that  should also receive paid ad  promotion on the survey?
[SPEAKER_18] 9305.5s - 9324.9s:  Through the speaker, going forward  and as we talk about the tripartite agreement  moving forward on that, it will be a very robust  process.  There will be paid ads, there will be  locations in parts of the city,  different parts of the city, so I think  moving forward on the real questions that  will be of importance to the City of Toronto,  we will be following that practice.
[SPEAKER_27] 9325.4s - 9340.8s:  Thank you and  in light of the survey,  the two question survey,  do staff believe that's an  exhaustive,  the two questions, exhaustive set  of questions to elicit feedback  from the body public?
[SPEAKER_24] 9343.7s - 9374.6s:  Through the speaker,  the staff  worked on the two questions,  first of all to try and get  respondents  to the survey and public  meeting participants to focus on  the RISA issue and then the second  question was  used as a  vehicle for people to provide comment  on the broader set of  issues that we would  want to be part of  the more comprehensive  conversation about the future of the report.
[SPEAKER_27] 9375.4s - 9391.7s:  Lastly,  on the water, the second question  framed  the consultation and the question  around  the waterfront.  Do staff believe this is  strictly a waterfront  issue?
[SPEAKER_24] 9392.9s - 9404.1s:  That was your last question?  Through the speakers, I think staff  are of the view that it is at the same time  a waterfront issue, a downtown  issue and a citywide issue and  actually a regional issue as well.
[SPEAKER_14] 9404.7s - 9407.0s:  Okay, thank you. We'll recess to  two o'clock.
