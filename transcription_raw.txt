591.8s - 596.9s:  Members of Council, we do have quorum. I will call this meeting to order.
598.8s - 604.8s:  The Clerk has advised that we do have quorum. Members of Council, please rise if you're able for the National Anthem.
619.1s - 630.5s:  The National Anthem
646.1s - 712.2s:  Please remain standing and join me in observing a moment of silence in memory of Chi Chiang Chiang,
712.3s - 724.7s:  Julia Cleveland, David Prochet, Razon Raman, Anna Sherlock, and five members of the Toronto Public Service from Toronto Shelter and Support Services.
749.1s - 763.8s:  Thank you. I would like to take a moment on behalf of Council to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples of all the lands that we are on today.
763.9s - 774.5s:  We do this to reaffirm our commitment and responsibility in improving relationships between nations and to deepening our own understanding of Indigenous peoples and their cultures.
774.6s - 779.2s:  It is a moment to reflect on the importance of this land, which we each call home.
779.2s - 790.9s:  We acknowledge the land we are meeting on is the traditional territory of many nations, including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishinaabe, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee, and the Wendats people,
791.2s - 795.4s:  and is now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit, and MÃ©tis peoples.
795.9s - 805.4s:  We also acknowledge that Toronto is covered by Treaty 13, with the Mississaugas of the Credit and the Williams Treaty signed with multiple Mississaugas and Chippewa bands.
805.4s - 815.6s:  For the benefit of those who are connected to the internet, City Clerk has posted all of the agenda materials for today's meeting at toronto.ca slash council.
816.3s - 820.8s:  This meeting is being held as a hybrid meeting and is being streamed live on YouTube.
821.2s - 825.5s:  I'd like to welcome the public who are here with us today and who are watching the meeting online.
826.5s - 832.7s:  Members, we do have a presentation this morning to recognize the 150 years of firefighting in Toronto.
832.7s - 836.3s:  I would like to call upon Mayor Chao to give the presentation.
845.5s - 846.1s:  Good morning.
847.0s - 855.5s:  We are pleased to have joining us today a number of guests, including Interim Fire Chief Larry Coco,
856.6s - 864.3s:  Deputy Fire Chief Jim Jessup, Paul Fitzgerald, and Kevin Helmerton, and Laura Boyd,
864.8s - 868.4s:  along with other Toronto services staff members.
868.4s - 877.5s:  President James Reid of the Toronto Professional Firefighters Association and their executive team are also here.
879.5s - 885.4s:  Chief Brett Crimm Schala from Toronto Paramedic Services,
886.0s - 891.3s:  and the staff superintendent Brett Nicole from Toronto Police Services,
891.8s - 897.9s:  along with members of the Toronto Fire Historical Society Toronto Fire Service Honour Guards,
897.9s - 908.1s:  Toronto Fire Service Pipe and Drum Band, and Toronto Fire Services World Veterans Association Colour Guard.
908.5s - 910.7s:  Welcome to the Council Chamber.
919.9s - 927.8s:  The City of Toronto is proud to have a fire service that delivers world-class fire protection services
927.8s - 932.2s:  to the people who live, work, and play in the city.
932.2s - 940.6s:  Today we have the privilege of celebrating 150 years of dedicated fire protection services in the City of Toronto,
941.3s - 949.7s:  an incredible milestone that highlights our long-standing commitment to safety and community resilience.
950.6s - 954.9s:  For many years, Toronto was served by a volunteer fire department,
954.9s - 965.6s:  and in 1874, the City Council of the day saw the importance of a full-time fire department
965.6s - 971.5s:  to give the residents of Toronto the best fire protection service possible.
972.2s - 982.3s:  At the time, the full-time department had just over 36 full-time members and used five horse-drawn fire engines,
982.3s - 986.3s:  but they were at the fire stations day and night.
987.0s - 990.9s:  Since that time, the city has transformed dramatically.
991.6s - 999.4s:  The five horses have been replaced with 124 trucks, cobblestone streets replaced by pavement,
999.9s - 1004.9s:  and wooden homes by concrete towers reaching high into the sky.
1005.7s - 1016.2s:  By the late 80s, the six fire departments serving each district corner of the pre-amalgamated city became one,
1017.2s - 1027.9s:  and we now have a fire service with 3,327 full-time staff serving the residents, businesses, and visitors of Toronto,
1028.5s - 1034.2s:  providing service from 84 fire stations around the city.
1034.2s - 1037.7s:  Today, we celebrate this incredible milestone.
1038.4s - 1044.3s:  We are joined by members of the Fire Services and Toronto Professional Firefighters Association
1044.3s - 1055.0s:  and countless others, both past and present, that represent the rich history and legacy of Toronto Fire Services.
1056.5s - 1060.7s:  This dedication of our Toronto Fire Services is commendable.
1060.7s - 1073.1s:  Their commitment to courage, compassion, and service reflects the core values that guides them in protecting our community.
1074.6s - 1080.8s:  Celebrating 150 years of world-class fire protection service is a remarkable achievement,
1081.5s - 1088.3s:  and one I, as the mayor, and we, as city council, are incurably proud of.
1088.3s - 1094.7s:  This achievement highlights the professionalism through changing times.
1095.6s - 1099.8s:  We, as a city council, remain committed to supporting these vital services,
1099.9s - 1106.7s:  ensuring that the residents of Toronto continue to receive world-class fire protection services.
1107.5s - 1117.0s:  So, on behalf of Toronto City Council and the residents of Toronto, congratulations on this achievement,
1117.0s - 1120.3s:  and thank you for protecting our city.
1121.1s - 1128.9s:  And now, we'll conclude this presentation with a short video highlighting 150 years of firefighting in Toronto.
1129.4s - 1132.3s:  Let's give them a big round of applause before we see the video.
1416.6s - 1423.4s:  I just want to stand up for a second, because this 150th anniversary is such an important one.
1423.8s - 1430.6s:  It also found time as the open house that Toronto Fire has every year.
1431.5s - 1434.8s:  I was so pleased, because the Fire Academy is in my ward.
1435.0s - 1441.6s:  I attended with the mayor, and there was over 2,000 Torontonians who took advantage and came through that day.
1442.0s - 1448.0s:  They saw so many things. They got education on fire. They saw how firefighters run up buildings.
1448.1s - 1452.9s:  They saw everything, and so many kids said, I want to be a firefighter.
1453.2s - 1455.2s:  So, that was pretty exciting.
1456.2s - 1465.2s:  Unfortunately, also, as the mayor pointed out, the statistic on the number of homes that have smoke detectors
1465.2s - 1468.6s:  is only every four out of ten homes.
1469.2s - 1474.6s:  So, that's a very low number, and I think probably on this 150th anniversary,
1474.9s - 1481.5s:  all of us as councillors in our communications could certainly promote that a bit more,
1481.5s - 1483.8s:  because that's quite a surprising statistic.
1483.8s - 1490.8s:  I also note that shortly after, very close to the Fire Academy, just down the street on Magee,
1491.5s - 1499.9s:  there was a fire that night where three homes were burnt because of somebody fixing their roof
1499.9s - 1501.7s:  and couldn't put the fire out.
1502.2s - 1506.8s:  Of course, our fire department was right there and got it out,
1507.0s - 1513.3s:  and as always, kept me in the loop as councillor as to what was happening and how difficult that fire was.
1513.3s - 1516.2s:  So, I just want to thank everybody again for that.
1518.6s - 1524.0s:  Because when we were at Chief Pegg's retirement, there was something very special that he got.
1524.0s - 1527.8s:  He got a lot of special things and a lot of accolades. It was a wonderful evening.
1528.2s - 1534.5s:  But we also got, from the historic services, the historical group in Toronto Fire,
1534.5s - 1547.1s:  we got the actual motion from City Council in 1874 that set up the fire department in the City of Toronto,
1547.1s - 1551.0s:  and it was very special, and thank you so much for bringing that here today.
1551.3s - 1558.8s:  So, I can share a motion that was very successful 150 years later that basically says,
1558.8s - 1565.5s:  Your committee therefore recommend that a company be organised to consist of 36 men.
1565.8s - 1570.9s:  Now, I'll just stop there for a second because our firefighting contingent is full of men and women.
1571.2s - 1579.0s:  So, a very different day 150 years ago. Don't feel badly. You're here now. You weren't there then.
1580.7s - 1588.1s:  Whose full time and attention shall be devoted to their duties as firemen and properly drilled therein,
1588.1s - 1596.4s:  which will not only meet the requirements of having men and women on the spot to render the necessary assistance
1596.4s - 1600.5s:  in getting the engines speedily to work on all occasions of fire,
1600.9s - 1606.2s:  but will also be more effective for general purposes as firemen than a larger company of men
1606.2s - 1610.6s:  who are generally every day at work at their various kinds of employment.
1610.9s - 1616.1s:  I don't need to remind you that the force was an all-volunteer force of 41 people,
1616.1s - 1623.8s:  and with this declaration and this committee declaration, it became 36 full-time firefighters in the City of Toronto.
1624.3s - 1631.9s:  The difference in cost between the partially paid company and a company of 36 men would be about $12,000 per year,
1632.2s - 1638.3s:  which your committee have no doubt would be more than compensated by the greater efficiency of the department.
1638.3s - 1648.0s:  All of this is respectfully submitted, Committee Room, Toronto, July 22nd, 1874, James B. Boustead, Chair.
1649.7s - 1655.7s:  Anyway, that is very exciting to see that. Councillor Candoval was there. He's not here this morning.
1656.0s - 1660.8s:  But he said, I wonder if there were any amendments, which I thought was very funny.
1661.7s - 1667.4s:  But there weren't. It was a straight up, here is the motion, here is what we're doing,
1667.4s - 1672.6s:  here we're setting up a fire department that has done us proud for 150 years.
1673.0s - 1678.4s:  So to all of those who have served with courage, compassion, and service,
1678.7s - 1683.8s:  which is the motto of the fire services here in Toronto,
1684.1s - 1690.0s:  I just think we owe them all a big, deep debt of gratitude and a big thank you
1690.0s - 1694.4s:  for serving always with courage, compassion, and service.
1694.4s - 1702.0s:  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Councillor Fletcher.
1703.4s - 1708.8s:  Thank you, Councillor Fletcher. Councillor Bravo.
1709.2s - 1716.3s:  Thank you. As chair of Economic and Community Development Committee, I also want to build on this spirit of gratitude.
1716.5s - 1719.4s:  I think that looking at the video and knowing the story,
1719.8s - 1725.2s:  this is one of the best examples of what we can do when we pool our resources together as a society
1725.2s - 1731.7s:  and build a professional service that offers us the protection that we need when we need it the most
1731.7s - 1737.4s:  in the worst crises. Yes, it's the fires. It's also the hazards, environmental hazards.
1738.3s - 1742.6s:  And it's the education and support. No matter who you are or where you live,
1742.6s - 1747.3s:  and even if you don't have a home, the Toronto Fire Service is there to make sure people are safe.
1748.3s - 1751.8s:  I think when you look at the video and you know the story of this fire service,
1751.8s - 1760.4s:  it's a story of growing commitment from the city in building the infrastructure that's needed to provide this service.
1760.5s - 1765.9s:  But it's also the story of the people, of the need to constantly improve safety for them,
1766.0s - 1770.2s:  for firefighters, working conditions, and the continuum of care,
1770.2s - 1772.8s:  which I think we should be really proud of in this fire service,
1772.9s - 1776.4s:  which has led on the focus on trauma support and recovery.
1776.4s - 1781.7s:  And it's something that I feel very proud of to say and to stand before you and to congratulate you on that.
1782.7s - 1787.9s:  This is really also about celebrating all of the catastrophes that haven't happened
1787.9s - 1794.0s:  because of prevention and all the work that's done to make sure that we don't get that call in the middle of the night.
1794.5s - 1798.9s:  I get the call. I've had five alarm fire at Dover Court in Bloor.
1799.4s - 1802.8s:  The partnership and support has been unbelievable.
1802.8s - 1809.6s:  The St. Anne's Fire, which made global news, and the care that was shown by the fire service to that faith community
1809.6s - 1813.3s:  and to Davenport in particular, I think I just want to say thank you
1813.3s - 1818.2s:  and to add my congratulations for the future that comes with us.
1818.4s - 1819.4s:  Take it.
1819.7s - 1821.2s:  Thank you, Councillor Bravo.
1822.2s - 1823.2s:  Councillor Colle.
1823.4s - 1831.0s:  Yeah, I just want to say that we just had a dangerous fire this morning at Bathurst and Eglinton
1831.0s - 1834.5s:  where a stolen car caught on fire.
1834.7s - 1842.4s:  Luckily, the TTC bus driver who was run into by the stolen car
1842.6s - 1849.8s:  pulled the person out of the vehicle that was on fire, and that person is now in hospital.
1850.3s - 1859.6s:  But let's also thank the other workers who work for our transit service, police, paramedics for their work.
1859.6s - 1865.3s:  And especially in this case, I want to give a big shout out to that TTC driver who risked his or her life
1865.3s - 1871.5s:  to pull that person out of that vehicle that was in flames at Bathurst and Eglinton.
1871.6s - 1872.5s:  Thank you.
1876.0s - 1877.0s:  Thank you.
1877.8s - 1879.7s:  Deputy Mayor Malik, on the item?
1879.9s - 1880.8s:  Yes, on the item.
1882.5s - 1883.5s:  Thank you very much.
1884.0s - 1889.5s:  I just want to echo the thanks and the recognition to Toronto Fire Services, as we've heard
1889.5s - 1895.2s:  and also experienced for over 100, well, for exactly 150 years,
1895.8s - 1901.3s:  Toronto firefighters have stood as guardians of our city and especially in a growing city,
1901.5s - 1907.3s:  whether it's fires that are in towers in downtown communities like mine
1907.3s - 1910.3s:  or whether it's careful and delicate rescues,
1910.5s - 1915.4s:  they have faced countless challenges with unwavering courage and determination
1915.4s - 1918.7s:  that characterizes their work and their service.
1918.7s - 1925.6s:  And it is selfless service and an unwavering commitment to protecting our communities.
1926.0s - 1927.6s:  And that's what makes them true heroes.
1927.7s - 1932.0s:  And I'm so glad that we are able to honor them as we begin our work today at council.
1932.5s - 1937.2s:  And beyond firefighting, we have heard the important role that Toronto's firefighters play
1937.2s - 1940.5s:  as community leaders and educators and as role models.
1940.9s - 1946.7s:  We've seen them participate in community events and workshops, education at our public schools
1946.7s - 1951.7s:  and at our local community centers, sharing their knowledge and expertise
1951.7s - 1957.0s:  with residents of all ages to ensure that fire protection and fire prevention
1957.0s - 1960.7s:  are something that we are capable and prepared for as a city.
1961.1s - 1964.6s:  And fostering that culture of fire safety and awareness,
1965.2s - 1969.6s:  they're helping to create safer, more resilient and more capable communities.
1970.0s - 1971.5s:  I want to echo Councillor Bravo.
1971.5s - 1976.2s:  You know, there's so many times where, as Councillors, we have gotten that call
1976.2s - 1981.0s:  that something has happened in our communities that requires our attention and our support.
1981.3s - 1986.2s:  And each and every time, that relief that fire services has acted so quickly,
1986.4s - 1991.5s:  so bravely and so efficiently to ensure that the minimal amount of harm has been done
1991.5s - 1996.1s:  and the most amount of work has been done to protect and support communities
1996.1s - 2000.5s:  in that incredibly difficult and sometimes tragic circumstance.
2000.5s - 2005.0s:  They're always there to lend a helping hand, whether it is, you know,
2005.0s - 2008.0s:  disasters like we're seeing through the climate crisis
2008.0s - 2013.1s:  or whether it's assisting a neighbor in need, very often being the first ones on site
2013.1s - 2017.4s:  and making sure that folks are reassured about what will happen next.
2017.7s - 2019.9s:  And to our firefighters, all of the ones who are here
2019.9s - 2022.5s:  and who are part of the service in every corner of the city,
2022.8s - 2026.4s:  thank you for this commitment, thank you for your courage and your selfnesses,
2026.5s - 2028.8s:  thank you for being the heroes that our city needs
2028.8s - 2031.3s:  and thank you for our continued work together.
2032.2s - 2033.0s:  Thank you.
2034.5s - 2038.2s:  I understand the city solicitor would like to make an introduction.
2043.8s - 2045.3s:  Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.
2046.0s - 2050.4s:  I wanted to welcome and introduce our six new articling students
2050.4s - 2052.2s:  that are here with us for a year.
2052.5s - 2053.9s:  If you could stand up.
2054.9s - 2058.1s:  And I will say your names and hopefully pronounce them all correctly.
2060.1s - 2061.4s:  Amanda Owusu.
2062.7s - 2064.4s:  Nicole Voskul.
2064.8s - 2066.0s:  Isha Patel.
2066.5s - 2067.5s:  Yelda Nury.
2068.7s - 2069.8s:  Camilla Conti.
2070.4s - 2071.4s:  And Douglas LaForest.
2071.8s - 2074.6s:  So they'll be working in the legal department for the next year.
2081.5s - 2083.0s:  Thank you and welcome.
2085.1s - 2088.9s:  May I have a motion to confirm the minutes?
2091.7s - 2093.6s:  Moved by Councillor Pasternak.
2093.6s - 2096.5s:  So if you can read the motion, please.
2098.8s - 2100.0s:  Oh, sorry, sorry.
2100.0s - 2100.9s:  There you go.
2101.4s - 2104.1s:  That City Council confirm the minutes from the regular meeting
2104.1s - 2107.3s:  held on July 24th and 25th, 2024,
2107.7s - 2110.8s:  and the special meeting held on September 5th, 2024,
2111.2s - 2112.9s:  in the form supplied to the members.
2113.7s - 2114.6s:  Thank you.
2116.5s - 2118.3s:  All those in favour, show of hands.
2118.5s - 2119.7s:  Opposed, if any, carried.
2120.1s - 2123.6s:  I will now call upon the committee chairs to introduce their reports.
2123.6s - 2126.7s:  The chairs can speak about the reports for up to five minutes.
2129.7s - 2133.6s:  Mayor Chao, you have a motion to introduce the Executive Committee report.
2133.9s - 2139.1s:  I do, and the motion is that the report from meeting 17
2139.1s - 2143.6s:  of the Executive Committee listed on the agenda of council
2143.6s - 2146.0s:  be presented for consideration.
2148.1s - 2153.8s:  Madam Speaker, we have quite a long meeting,
2153.8s - 2157.8s:  and there were many items that went into the evening.
2158.5s - 2161.8s:  The first one, 17.1,
2162.3s - 2166.4s:  is building a universal student food program in Toronto,
2167.2s - 2170.7s:  something that I've been working on for many decades
2170.7s - 2174.4s:  since the late 80s, early 90s,
2174.4s - 2179.5s:  and what is in front of you is a plan,
2179.9s - 2182.2s:  asking for a more comprehensive plan,
2182.2s - 2188.0s:  but to start, we're looking to see if we could feed 8,000 kids
2188.0s - 2191.8s:  as of January 1st, because the winter is going to be tough.
2192.4s - 2194.7s:  We know that Thanksgiving is upon us,
2194.8s - 2200.1s:  and it will be a tough year for Daily Bread Food Bank
2200.1s - 2202.7s:  because the needs have increased,
2203.4s - 2205.4s:  because the rent is so high,
2205.5s - 2208.8s:  and people even working with several jobs
2208.8s - 2212.0s:  are having a hard time making ends meet,
2212.4s - 2217.2s:  which means that right now, 10.15, 10.13,
2217.8s - 2222.0s:  there are children in schools across Toronto
2222.0s - 2226.9s:  that may not be able to focus because they are hungry.
2227.6s - 2233.7s:  So this program, this motion in front of us in the Executive
2233.7s - 2236.7s:  asked us to come back with a plan in November.
2236.7s - 2240.2s:  The cost and how we're going to do it.
2240.9s - 2244.3s:  The next item is something that we've debated quite a bit,
2244.5s - 2246.1s:  which is the electric ferries.
2246.5s - 2249.1s:  You have seen different discussion
2249.1s - 2253.1s:  about whether our ferry is safe.
2253.3s - 2254.7s:  Of course, it is safe.
2254.7s - 2256.8s:  There was a presentation at the Executive
2256.8s - 2260.0s:  about our ferry services,
2260.5s - 2263.7s:  and that because we have ordered the electric ferries,
2263.7s - 2268.6s:  we want to make sure that there is the dock
2268.6s - 2272.9s:  that could accommodate these new ferries,
2273.3s - 2278.3s:  plus there would be more people able to be on these ferries,
2278.4s - 2282.2s:  so the dock and the whole area needs some kind of change.
2283.8s - 2285.6s:  The next item, Madam Speaker,
2285.9s - 2289.8s:  is one that I believe you are very, very interested in
2289.8s - 2293.8s:  because last year the rollout of the VHT
2293.8s - 2295.5s:  causes a lot of anguish.
2295.7s - 2297.4s:  A lot of seniors were scared.
2297.7s - 2300.7s:  Those that cannot speak English didn't know what to do.
2300.7s - 2302.1s:  They were crying on the phone.
2302.2s - 2304.5s:  They were lined up at City Hall
2304.5s - 2308.1s:  and all the centres trying to figure out
2308.1s - 2314.5s:  because 160,000 homeowners were receiving a note
2314.5s - 2317.2s:  to say that their tax had gone up dramatically,
2317.2s - 2320.2s:  which scared them, and it was unnecessary.
2320.3s - 2321.4s:  It was a big mistake.
2323.3s - 2325.7s:  So this year, in this report,
2326.1s - 2328.8s:  it's a redesign of the entire program,
2331.4s - 2334.1s:  and there's a lot of details in it,
2334.1s - 2336.9s:  and I think there will be a presentation
2336.9s - 2341.8s:  for members of council so that you can become familiar with it
2341.8s - 2343.9s:  because it's quite different than last year.
2343.9s - 2347.3s:  It's a lot easier to apply.
2348.0s - 2350.2s:  There will be a lot more communication,
2350.4s - 2352.4s:  multilingual communication,
2354.2s - 2356.8s:  and perhaps some members of council
2356.8s - 2360.2s:  will have some suggestions to improve it even further.
2360.4s - 2362.7s:  Well, that item is going to be on,
2363.0s - 2367.3s:  and I do know that the city staff have worked very hard,
2367.3s - 2370.9s:  and I believe they visited about two-thirds
2371.7s - 2376.7s:  of members of council in coming up with this plan.
2377.2s - 2380.4s:  So those of you that have not had the time to visit,
2380.8s - 2383.1s:  to get a briefing, you will see it today.
2383.7s - 2385.3s:  So put your thinking cap on.
2385.6s - 2387.7s:  How do you think this can be improved
2387.7s - 2389.9s:  and let the city staff know?
2390.9s - 2393.5s:  Because it is a very important initiative
2393.5s - 2396.5s:  that we've done for several years.
2398.3s - 2402.8s:  Judging from the folks from Billy Bishop Airport,
2403.1s - 2404.6s:  welcome to council chamber.
2405.5s - 2407.7s:  We will be discussing that item
2407.7s - 2411.2s:  on the runway and safety areas
2411.2s - 2416.7s:  and on how we could make sure the passengers are safe
2416.7s - 2419.4s:  and continue to support the airport.
2419.9s - 2423.2s:  That item, I believe, will have a lot of discussion
2423.2s - 2427.0s:  because there are different options out there,
2428.7s - 2430.6s:  and then the questions about costs
2430.6s - 2432.8s:  and financing, et cetera.
2433.1s - 2434.6s:  So it's sort of complex,
2434.9s - 2439.3s:  and I believe the city staff can certainly answer
2439.3s - 2442.4s:  several questions, whether it's option one, two, or three,
2442.8s - 2445.8s:  and the financing and the tripartite agreement, et cetera.
2446.7s - 2448.4s:  I know I'm running out of time.
2448.7s - 2452.0s:  Just one other item that's really important
2452.0s - 2455.1s:  because Councillor Moyes has been really pushing
2455.1s - 2456.5s:  on the St. Lawrence Centre.
2456.8s - 2457.8s:  Can we afford it?
2457.8s - 2459.4s:  Will we be able to go ahead?
2459.5s - 2460.8s:  That item is also on.
2461.5s - 2462.9s:  And there are different...
2462.9s - 2465.7s:  One item that you might be interested, Madam Speaker,
2465.9s - 2469.1s:  is that the water capital budget,
2469.6s - 2472.4s:  2024 budget and the capital budget adjustment,
2472.5s - 2475.8s:  because that is where the funds comes from
2475.8s - 2477.3s:  on flood mitigation.
2477.9s - 2481.9s:  So a very heavy agenda that is in front of us
2481.9s - 2484.3s:  and lots to discuss.
2484.8s - 2485.2s:  Thank you.
2485.3s - 2485.9s:  Thank you.
2494.6s - 2497.0s:  Councillor Moyes, you have a motion
2497.0s - 2499.1s:  to introduce the Board of Health report.
2500.0s - 2501.2s:  Yes, I do.
2502.0s - 2504.7s:  That the report for meeting 16 of the Board of Health
2504.7s - 2508.6s:  listed on the agenda of council be presented for consideration.
2510.1s - 2512.6s:  Last month, the Board of Health returned to session
2512.6s - 2516.6s:  with a full agenda of items pertinent to the health
2516.6s - 2518.2s:  and well-being of our city.
2518.5s - 2521.9s:  Top of our minds with the beginning of the school year
2521.9s - 2523.5s:  was the student nutrition program.
2524.7s - 2526.2s:  Today, at the Board's request,
2526.2s - 2529.1s:  we have received a report from the Medical Office of Health
2529.1s - 2532.1s:  outlining a phased approach to realizing
2532.1s - 2534.3s:  a universal student nutrition program,
2534.9s - 2537.7s:  an expansion for which there is critical need.
2539.6s - 2543.1s:  Also pressing has been response to the provincial announcement
2543.1s - 2546.5s:  of changes to the regulation of safe consumption sites
2546.5s - 2550.8s:  and $378 million in funding for new homeless
2550.8s - 2554.1s:  and addiction recovery treatment known as heart hubs.
2555.3s - 2556.3s:  Following this announcement,
2556.6s - 2559.6s:  Toronto Public Health was notified by the province
2559.6s - 2563.6s:  of the supervised consumption services at 277 Victoria Street
2563.6s - 2566.8s:  will cease by March 31, 2025.
2568.1s - 2571.6s:  As we learn more about what the new regulations mean
2571.6s - 2573.5s:  for sites across the city,
2573.5s - 2577.3s:  we have been working to determine the path forward
2577.3s - 2579.6s:  to ensure that people are able to receive
2579.6s - 2583.7s:  the full continuum of care and services that they need.
2584.8s - 2585.8s:  At our last meeting,
2586.3s - 2589.8s:  the board requested that the province continue to fund
2589.8s - 2593.6s:  all currently operating supervised consumption services
2593.6s - 2597.1s:  and consumption and treatment services sites
2597.1s - 2599.7s:  beyond March 31, 2025,
2600.4s - 2603.4s:  and all supervised consumption services to be housed
2603.4s - 2605.7s:  at the new heart hubs.
2607.1s - 2610.9s:  Finally, as the year begins to draw to a close,
2611.4s - 2614.0s:  so does our time with Dr. de Villa
2614.0s - 2616.2s:  as our Medical Office of Health.
2617.2s - 2619.5s:  Preparations for her departure continue
2619.5s - 2622.6s:  as the Medical Officer of Health and Hiring Committee
2622.6s - 2625.5s:  has conducted preliminary interviews
2625.5s - 2628.2s:  with a number of highly qualified candidates
2628.2s - 2630.1s:  from across the country.
2631.2s - 2632.8s:  We will be ready to appoint
2632.8s - 2634.4s:  a new Medical Officer of Health
2634.4s - 2636.3s:  at our November board meeting
2636.3s - 2639.2s:  before seeking council approval in December.
2639.7s - 2640.6s:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.
2641.3s - 2642.7s:  Thank you.
2648.8s - 2650.9s:  Councillor Chang, you have a motion
2650.9s - 2653.8s:  to introduce a Civic Appointments Committee report.
2654.5s - 2654.9s:  Yes.
2655.7s - 2658.2s:  I would like to move that the report for meeting 18
2658.2s - 2659.6s:  of the Civic Appointments Committee
2659.6s - 2662.8s:  listed on the agenda of council be presented for consideration.
2663.5s - 2665.7s:  I just want to encourage my councillor colleagues
2665.7s - 2668.8s:  to promote our many, many boards
2668.8s - 2670.3s:  where people can participate.
2670.8s - 2673.5s:  We want people to know that their voices matter,
2673.5s - 2675.1s:  and it's a very meaningful way.
2675.7s - 2679.0s:  Sometimes we are wrestling at Civic Appointments
2679.0s - 2681.1s:  because we're not sure that we're getting
2681.1s - 2683.8s:  the diverse pool that we wish we could have,
2684.2s - 2687.6s:  and so the website that you can direct everyone to
2687.6s - 2690.6s:  is toronto.ca backslash shapeyourcity.
2691.1s - 2693.7s:  I hope that you can include it in your newsletters,
2693.7s - 2697.2s:  and let's make our boards and committees
2697.2s - 2699.6s:  representative of the diversity of our city.
2699.6s - 2701.0s:  Thank you.
2701.8s - 2703.1s:  Thank you.
2709.5s - 2711.8s:  Councillor Bravo, you have a motion
2711.8s - 2713.4s:  to introduce the Economic
2713.4s - 2715.5s:  and Community Development Committee report.
2716.0s - 2717.1s:  I do. Thank you, Speaker.
2717.3s - 2719.6s:  I move that the report for meeting 15
2719.6s - 2722.1s:  of the Economic and Community Development Committee
2722.1s - 2723.7s:  listed on the agenda of council
2723.7s - 2725.6s:  be presented for consideration.
2726.4s - 2727.7s:  I just want to speak briefly
2727.7s - 2731.2s:  to some of the highlights of our 15th meeting.
2731.7s - 2734.9s:  We appointed the first youth poet laureate,
2735.2s - 2739.1s:  Shahada Jack, to great celebration
2739.1s - 2741.7s:  in the community and among organizations
2741.7s - 2742.5s:  representing youth.
2743.6s - 2745.8s:  We heard about the expansion
2745.8s - 2747.7s:  of the diversity fellows program,
2748.2s - 2749.5s:  an update of the program,
2749.6s - 2753.6s:  which will include vital Indigenous youth fellow program
2753.6s - 2756.2s:  that's been thoughtfully and carefully crafted
2756.2s - 2759.5s:  by staff in consultation with community.
2760.5s - 2761.3s:  And we heard the report
2761.3s - 2763.5s:  of the Los Angeles mission,
2763.7s - 2765.2s:  which was highly successful
2765.2s - 2766.8s:  in highlighting the stability
2766.8s - 2768.3s:  of our film industry in Toronto,
2768.9s - 2770.9s:  the concierge services that are offered
2770.9s - 2773.3s:  to the industry, and the quality
2773.3s - 2774.6s:  of our crews and our workers,
2774.7s - 2775.9s:  our workforce here in Toronto.
2776.7s - 2777.3s:  Thank you, Speaker.
2778.6s - 2779.5s:  Thank you.
2786.2s - 2788.1s:  Councillor Ainslie, you have a motion
2788.1s - 2790.7s:  to introduce General Government Committee report.
2790.7s - 2797.5s:  Good morning.
2797.6s - 2800.4s:  Madam Speaker, that the report for meeting number 16
2800.4s - 2801.9s:  of the General Government Committee
2801.9s - 2803.8s:  listed on the agenda of council
2803.8s - 2805.3s:  be presented for consideration.
2805.8s - 2806.7s:  Thank you.
2814.5s - 2815.5s:  Councillor McKelvie,
2815.7s - 2817.4s:  you have a motion to introduce
2817.4s - 2819.7s:  Infrastructure and Environment Committee report.
2820.6s - 2821.4s:  Thank you, Madam Speaker,
2821.4s - 2823.2s:  that the report for meeting 16
2823.2s - 2824.6s:  of the Infrastructure and Environment Committee
2824.6s - 2825.7s:  listed on the agenda of council
2825.7s - 2827.4s:  be presented for consideration.
2827.4s - 2830.2s:  There are some great topics on there.
2830.2s - 2832.1s:  Everybody loves congestion, right?
2832.4s - 2833.8s:  So there's a report on that,
2833.8s - 2835.4s:  and everybody loves construction.
2835.9s - 2837.4s:  There's a report on that, too.
2837.6s - 2839.1s:  And we all love EV chargers,
2839.1s - 2840.4s:  and there's a report on that.
2840.4s - 2842.9s:  So I do ask that
2843.6s - 2845.4s:  you do try to advance
2845.4s - 2847.8s:  Circulate Your Motion so that we can move
2847.8s - 2849.4s:  efficiently through the
2849.4s - 2851.9s:  infrastructure items and also have
2851.9s - 2853.7s:  staff review those from a
2853.7s - 2854.6s:  technical standpoint.
2854.6s - 2856.5s:  I will say on congestion,
2856.6s - 2858.8s:  the report is exceptionally
2858.8s - 2860.7s:  and it was very well prepared
2860.7s - 2862.6s:  by city staff. And importantly,
2862.6s - 2864.4s:  it doesn't just talk about the new recommendations,
2864.5s - 2866.6s:  the new things they're adding, but there are
2866.6s - 2868.6s:  tables that are in there that describe all
2868.6s - 2869.9s:  the actions that are underway.
2870.4s - 2872.5s:  And there will be soon a dashboard
2872.5s - 2874.6s:  that is launched. So I think it's important
2874.6s - 2876.6s:  that we remember that while we're only voting on
2876.6s - 2878.4s:  a few motions today
2878.4s - 2880.4s:  related to congestion, there is a very large
2880.4s - 2882.4s:  body of work around that. So please also
2882.4s - 2884.3s:  have a look at that as you prepare your motions.
2884.6s - 2889.2s:  Thank you. Thank you.
2897.9s - 2899.3s:  Councillor Perks, you have a motion
2899.3s - 2901.3s:  to introduce the Planning and Housing Committee
2901.3s - 2901.8s:  report.
2903.1s - 2904.2s:  Thank you, Speaker.
2905.3s - 2906.8s:  Looking for my motion here.
2907.7s - 2910.1s:  There it is. I move that the report
2910.1s - 2912.3s:  from meeting 15 of the Planning and Housing Committee
2912.3s - 2914.4s:  listed on the agenda of council be presented
2914.4s - 2916.2s:  for consideration. And given
2916.2s - 2917.9s:  that it was one of our shorter meetings,
2918.2s - 2920.4s:  this is one of the shorter speeches to introduce an item.
2923.1s - 2924.1s:  Thank you.
2930.1s - 2932.1s:  Councillor Holyday,
2933.0s - 2934.2s:  you have a motion
2934.2s - 2936.1s:  to introduce the Etobicoke York
2936.1s - 2937.6s:  Community Council report.
2938.3s - 2940.0s:  I do thank you and good morning
2940.0s - 2942.8s:  to you, Madam Speaker. I would
2942.8s - 2944.9s:  like to move that the report from
2944.9s - 2947.0s:  meeting 16 of the Etobicoke
2947.0s - 2948.8s:  York Community Council listed
2948.8s - 2950.3s:  on the agenda of council
2950.3s - 2952.2s:  be presented for consideration.
2952.7s - 2954.8s:  Thank you. Thank you.
2958.1s - 2958.4s:  Councillor
2964.0s - 2964.6s:  Pasternak,
2964.6s - 2966.9s:  you have a motion to introduce
2968.2s - 2969.4s:  the North York
2969.4s - 2970.8s:  Community Council report.
2971.9s - 2973.7s:  Yes, thank you, Madam Speaker.
2975.1s - 2976.1s:  That the report from meeting
2976.1s - 2977.9s:  17 of North York Community Council
2977.9s - 2980.1s:  listed on the agenda of council be presented
2980.1s - 2980.9s:  for consideration.
2981.7s - 2983.1s:  Thank you.
2987.1s - 2989.1s:  Councillor Mantis,
2989.4s - 2991.6s:  you have a motion to introduce
2991.6s - 2993.4s:  the Scarborough Community Council
2993.4s - 2995.5s:  report. Yes, thank you, Madam
2995.5s - 2997.3s:  Speaker. That the report from
2997.3s - 2999.4s:  meeting 16 of the Scarborough Community Council
2999.4s - 3001.6s:  listed on the agenda of council be presented
3001.6s - 3003.1s:  for consideration. Thank you.
3003.3s - 3006.8s:  Thank you. Councillor
3006.8s - 3008.8s:  Moyes, you have a motion
3008.8s - 3010.8s:  to introduce the Toronto and East York
3010.8s - 3012.2s:  Community Council report.
3015.9s - 3017.8s:  That the report meeting 16
3017.8s - 3019.7s:  of the Toronto and East York Community Council
3019.7s - 3021.7s:  listed on the agenda for council be presented
3021.7s - 3024.8s:  for consideration. Thank you.
3031.1s - 3032.2s:  May I have a motion
3032.2s - 3033.9s:  to introduce a new business from
3033.9s - 3035.4s:  the mayor and city officials
3035.4s - 3037.4s:  moved by Councillor Crisanti.
3037.6s - 3039.1s:  I can read the motion.
3044.7s - 3046.3s:  There you go. Thank you,
3046.4s - 3048.3s:  Speaker, and good morning. That the new business
3048.3s - 3050.2s:  from the mayor and city officials
3050.2s - 3052.6s:  listed on the agenda of council be presented
3052.6s - 3054.5s:  for consideration. Thank

3812.6s - 3814.9s:  here now to assist. I'd like to
3814.9s - 3816.6s:  make time specific EX
3816.6s - 3818.9s:  17.17 update on
3818.9s - 3820.2s:  the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts
3820.6s - 3822.5s:  Redevelopment Project. Okay, I don't think they
3822.5s - 3824.8s:  can hear you. Can you speak into the mic?
3825.1s - 3826.0s:  Oh, thank you, speaker.
3826.5s - 3828.8s:  Time specific EX 17.17
3829.4s - 3830.7s:  update on the St. Lawrence
3830.7s - 3832.2s:  Centre for the Arts Redevelopment
3832.2s - 3834.3s:  Project. And that
3834.3s - 3836.4s:  I'd like to have that after
3836.4s - 3838.3s:  the members' motions tomorrow afternoon,
3838.7s - 3840.5s:  please. Thank you.
3840.6s - 3841.4s:  All in favour?
3842.5s - 3881.0s:  Carried. Okay, thank
3881.0s - 3881.6s:  you.
3887.4s - 3889.3s:  All those in favour of adopting
3889.3s - 3891.6s:  the balance of the order paper as amended
3891.6s - 3893.0s:  and all items not held,
3893.1s - 3895.6s:  please raise your hands. All in favour?
3895.9s - 3897.2s:  Show of hands. Opposed?
3897.5s - 3898.6s:  If any. Carried.
3899.1s - 3901.2s:  Members, I want to remind you that regardless
3901.2s - 3903.6s:  of whether you are attending today's meeting by video
3903.6s - 3905.6s:  conference or in person, you will continue
3905.6s - 3907.2s:  to submit and approve your motions
3907.2s - 3909.5s:  in advance. The clerk's
3909.5s - 3911.2s:  staff are available to assist you with
3911.2s - 3913.3s:  motions. If you do not have your
3913.3s - 3915.1s:  motion ready, I will not recognize
3915.1s - 3917.1s:  you. I'm also reminding members
3917.1s - 3919.3s:  that you must state your motion first before
3919.3s - 3921.1s:  you speak to it. Members,
3921.2s - 3923.3s:  if you have an urgent motion without notice
3923.3s - 3925.1s:  you wish to bring forward at this meeting
3925.1s - 3927.1s:  and your seconder must submit
3927.1s - 3928.9s:  it by email to the clerk's staff.
3928.9s - 3931.5s:  Your motion must also clearly state
3931.5s - 3932.9s:  the reason for urgency.
3933.3s - 3935.1s:  Staff will prepare the necessary
3935.1s - 3937.1s:  procedure motion for my review along
3937.1s - 3943.9s:  with your motion. I will
3943.9s - 3945.7s:  review all motions without notice
3945.7s - 3947.9s:  carefully. I may ask you to provide more
3947.9s - 3950.1s:  information about the urgency of your motion
3950.1s - 3951.5s:  and why it can't be
3951.5s - 3953.8s:  rooted through normal committee channels.
3954.2s - 3955.7s:  This will inform my decision
3955.7s - 3957.7s:  on whether to consent to your motion and
3957.7s - 3959.7s:  in turn, council's decision
3959.7s - 3961.8s:  about whether to add your motion to the
3961.8s - 3963.9s:  agenda. The purpose of your motion
3963.9s - 3965.8s:  and your reason for urgency must be
3965.8s - 3967.8s:  made very clear. I will
3967.8s - 3969.9s:  advise council after each recess
3969.9s - 3971.8s:  which motions I have agreed
3971.8s - 3974.0s:  on that are urgent that need a motion
3974.0s - 3975.9s:  to add to the agenda. It will
3975.9s - 3978.1s:  require 18 votes to add a motion
3978.1s - 3979.9s:  without notice to the agenda during
3979.9s - 3982.3s:  the meeting. Motions added
3982.3s - 3983.9s:  to the agenda in this way
3983.9s - 3985.9s:  are not subject to a vote to waive
3985.9s - 3988.0s:  referral to a committee or agency.
3988.4s - 3990.2s:  We will now go to the mayor's
3990.2s - 3992.0s:  key item which is EX
3992.0s - 3994.2s:  17.5.
3996.8s - 3998.4s:  So on 17.5
3998.4s - 4000.4s:  which is the Billy Bishop Toronto
4000.4s - 4001.3s:  City Airport.
4002.7s - 4004.6s:  So do we have any questions to staff
4004.6s - 4005.9s:  if you do?
4006.2s - 4008.3s:  Councillor Fletcher. We're having this issue
4008.3s - 4010.2s:  again like we had last time.
4010.5s - 4012.3s:  Pardon? I've said I think we're
4012.3s - 4013.8s:  having this issue again
4013.8s - 4016.4s:  where there's not everybody here
4016.4s - 4018.2s:  but we don't know who's online.
4019.1s - 4020.0s:  So that
4021.4s - 4022.5s:  public doesn't know.
4022.7s - 4024.3s:  I don't know. That's a bit odd.
4024.7s - 4026.6s:  I think we used to have that
4027.8s - 4028.2s:  because
4028.7s - 4030.4s:  they're on YouTube and they see
4030.4s - 4032.4s:  that but we don't see it. So I've
4032.4s - 4034.4s:  only got two devices. I don't know how to
4034.4s - 4036.4s:  set up the YouTube as well. I don't think I should
4036.4s - 4038.3s:  have three. So I don't know what
4038.3s - 4040.3s:  the issue is. We used to have that
4040.3s - 4042.3s:  on our screens and understand who
4042.3s - 4044.4s:  was here and who was. So I just
4044.4s - 4046.4s:  find that a bit
4046.4s - 4048.2s:  off putting it up. Troubling.
4048.2s - 4049.0s:  Thank you.
4049.0s - 4050.5s:  Is there some way to deal with that?
4050.8s - 4053.1s:  I'm asking how we're dealing with that.
4053.4s - 4055.6s:  Okay. So we'll check the staff
4056.2s - 4057.9s:  because can you actually
4057.9s - 4060.1s:  tell me who's on the screen because I don't see anything.
4060.2s - 4060.9s:  You can't tell either?
4061.6s - 4062.6s:  Oh, gee.
4067.0s - 4069.2s:  Okay. So let the staff
4069.2s - 4070.9s:  work on that for a while, Councillor Fletcher.
4071.7s - 4073.4s:  Okay. Thank you.
4075.1s - 4076.2s:  Okay. Thank you.
4076.5s - 4078.8s:  Well, before we go to the
4078.8s - 4081.1s:  mayor's first key item for questions,
4082.3s - 4083.2s:  it is
4083.2s - 4084.4s:  past 1030.
4085.3s - 4087.0s:  And Councillor Bravo, you wish
4087.0s - 4088.5s:  to make an
4088.5s - 4091.1s:  introduction on the Davenport Perth
4091.1s - 4092.7s:  Community Neighbourhood and Community
4092.7s - 4094.6s:  Health Centre. Councillor Bravo.
4095.8s - 4097.1s:  Thank you so much, speaker.
4097.2s - 4099.2s:  I want to draw council's attention
4099.2s - 4101.3s:  to the presence with us today
4101.3s - 4102.9s:  of the Participatory
4102.9s - 4104.2s:  Democracy Group,
4104.8s - 4106.7s:  a committee that I've been meeting with
4106.7s - 4108.9s:  at Davenport Perth Neighborhood Centre.
4109.5s - 4110.8s:  And to recognize, please
4110.8s - 4111.8s:  stand up.
4113.0s - 4115.3s:  To recognize that there's more than four
4115.3s - 4117.6s:  decades here of local community
4117.6s - 4119.7s:  leadership, volunteering,
4120.5s - 4121.1s:  participation,
4121.8s - 4123.6s:  trying to motivate
4123.6s - 4125.3s:  residents to become more
4125.3s - 4127.4s:  active in democracy.
4128.1s - 4129.4s:  And so it's been a real privilege
4129.4s - 4131.2s:  for me to work with all of you and to learn
4131.2s - 4133.3s:  from you. Just want to welcome you
4133.3s - 4135.2s:  there observing council today. Welcome.
4141.0s - 4142.4s:  Thank you. Welcome.
4147.7s - 4148.6s:  So we'll go to
4148.6s - 4150.5s:  EX 17.5.
4152.2s - 4152.7s:  And mayor,
4152.8s - 4154.5s:  do you know if your students are in?
4162.0s - 4163.8s:  The staff has a presentation on
4163.8s - 4165.9s:  this item. Oh, okay.
4166.2s - 4167.7s:  But do you know
4167.7s - 4170.1s:  if the grade five students are
4170.1s - 4172.3s:  here that you're going to introduce?
4172.7s - 4173.9s:  No? I don't see them yet.
4173.9s - 4175.8s:  Okay. We'll wait until they come and then
4175.8s - 4177.9s:  we'll acknowledge the students. Hasn't
4177.9s - 4180.3s:  arrived yet. Okay. So
4180.3s - 4182.4s:  I believe that the staff has the
4182.4s - 4183.9s:  presentation on this item,
4184.5s - 4186.3s:  which is EX 17.5.
4191.4s - 4192.2s:  Good morning, members
4192.2s - 4194.5s:  of council. My name is David Stonehouse
4194.5s - 4196.2s:  and I am the director of the city's waterfront
4196.7s - 4198.3s:  secretariat. Before I
4198.3s - 4199.8s:  begin, I just want to acknowledge
4199.8s - 4202.4s:  that there are staff here from Ports Toronto
4202.4s - 4204.5s:  and from Transport Canada.
4204.9s - 4206.5s:  Thank you to them for coming
4206.5s - 4212.3s:  today. Just by way
4212.3s - 4214.8s:  of preamble, staff
4214.8s - 4217.3s:  felt that it was important to
4217.7s - 4219.4s:  emphasize that this report,
4219.7s - 4221.7s:  this decision, is not about closing the
4221.7s - 4223.2s:  Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport.
4223.9s - 4225.7s:  This report is about how best to
4225.7s - 4227.6s:  achieve compliance with a new federal
4227.6s - 4229.9s:  aviation safety requirement,
4230.9s - 4231.6s:  runway and
4231.6s - 4233.7s:  safety areas. In a
4233.7s - 4235.6s:  tight time frame, design
4235.6s - 4237.7s:  and construction must be advanced
4237.7s - 4239.4s:  rapidly for Ports Toronto
4239.4s - 4241.7s:  to meet Transport Canada's July
4241.7s - 4244.0s:  12, 2027
4244.0s - 4246.4s:  deadline. And
4246.4s - 4248.2s:  longer term, this report
4248.2s - 4250.3s:  and this decision is about the need for
4250.3s - 4252.3s:  a broader discussion about the future
4252.3s - 4254.5s:  of the airport, best achieved
4254.5s - 4256.2s:  through an airport
4256.2s - 4257.9s:  master plan update
4257.9s - 4259.8s:  that would be led by Ports Toronto.
4262.6s - 4264.2s:  In terms of the new regulations,
4264.8s - 4266.3s:  there is a new federal
4266.3s - 4268.3s:  airport safety requirement that
4268.3s - 4270.3s:  must be met at all of Canada's
4270.3s - 4272.2s:  airports for runway
4272.2s - 4274.2s:  and safety areas. The
4274.2s - 4276.1s:  intention of these runway
4276.1s - 4278.3s:  and safety areas is to reduce the
4278.3s - 4280.3s:  severity of damage to
4280.3s - 4282.2s:  aircraft, an aircraft if
4282.2s - 4284.1s:  it overshoots or overruns
4284.6s - 4286.6s:  a runway. Transport
4286.6s - 4288.6s:  Canada has identified three
4288.6s - 4290.6s:  ways that airports can meet runway and
4290.6s - 4291.8s:  safety area requirements.
4292.7s - 4294.5s:  First, to prepare natural compacted
4295.4s - 4296.5s:  open areas at the
4296.5s - 4298.7s:  ends of a runway. Second,
4298.9s - 4300.6s:  to install an engineered material,
4301.4s - 4302.6s:  an engineered
4302.6s - 4304.4s:  material arresting system, also called
4304.4s - 4306.4s:  EMAS, designed to
4306.4s - 4307.6s:  decelerate an aircraft.
4308.7s - 4310.7s:  And third, shorten a runway's declared
4310.7s - 4312.4s:  distance, so to shorten a runway.
4314.1s - 4315.6s:  RISA compliance is the responsibility
4316.0s - 4317.7s:  of airports. However,
4318.2s - 4319.5s:  approvals from others may
4319.5s - 4322.6s:  be required. So how is the
4322.6s - 4323.6s:  City of Toronto involved?
4325.0s - 4326.9s:  The Billy Bishop Airport is governed by a
4326.9s - 4329.2s:  tripartite agreement between Ports Toronto,
4329.5s - 4331.1s:  the City of Toronto and Transport
4331.1s - 4333.1s:  Canada. The agreement was
4333.1s - 4334.8s:  originally signed in 1983.
4334.8s - 4337.3s:  It serves as both a lease
4337.3s - 4339.4s:  and an operating agreement. And it is
4339.4s - 4341.3s:  important to point out that the
4341.3s - 4343.0s:  airport was operating prior
4343.0s - 4345.2s:  to 1983. It actually has a
4345.2s - 4346.8s:  history that goes back to
4348.2s - 4349.1s:  World War II.
4351.0s - 4352.1s:  Any tripartite agreement
4352.1s - 4354.1s:  changes would require three agreement
4354.1s - 4355.3s:  signatories to agree.
4356.6s - 4358.2s:  At Toronto Island Airport,
4358.2s - 4360.2s:  runway and safety area options
4360.2s - 4362.3s:  would require additional landmass through Lake
4362.3s - 4364.4s:  Fill, requiring a change to the
4364.4s - 4365.8s:  tripartite agreement,
4366.5s - 4367.9s:  and a City Council decision.
4373.9s - 4375.3s:  Ports Toronto is conducting an environmental
4375.3s - 4377.4s:  assessment to evaluate three options for
4377.4s - 4379.1s:  runway and safety areas
4379.1s - 4381.5s:  implementation that would prepare natural
4381.5s - 4383.3s:  compacted open areas.
4383.6s - 4385.4s:  And you'll hear more about these in a minute.
4386.7s - 4388.2s:  Options which would have
4388.2s - 4389.9s:  shortened the runway's declared distance
4389.9s - 4391.8s:  were not considered viable by
4391.8s - 4394.1s:  Ports Toronto, as they would impact
4394.1s - 4395.9s:  the Q400 aircraft
4395.9s - 4397.9s:  operations. The Q400 planes
4397.9s - 4400.2s:  are the planes that are used now
4400.2s - 4401.9s:  for commercial purposes, flown by
4401.9s - 4403.8s:  Porter, flown by Air Canada.
4405.5s - 4407.0s:  Ports Toronto has also looked at
4407.3s - 4409.1s:  the engineered material arresting
4409.1s - 4410.9s:  system. And this
4410.9s - 4412.7s:  also was not considered viable
4412.7s - 4414.8s:  by Ports Toronto, for
4414.8s - 4416.1s:  a number of reasons,
4417.5s - 4418.8s:  including it
4418.8s - 4420.6s:  is a rather
4420.6s - 4422.9s:  new technology to Canada. It hasn't
4422.9s - 4424.0s:  been used in Canada.
4425.4s - 4426.7s:  Not considered
4428.1s - 4428.7s:  operational
4428.7s - 4431.1s:  in terms of cold
4431.1s - 4432.7s:  climates, or at least
4434.8s - 4435.8s:  challenging in terms
4435.8s - 4437.7s:  of cold climates, and also a
4437.7s - 4441.8s:  single supplier. So
4441.8s - 4444.4s:  the first option for
4444.4s - 4446.2s:  consideration, option one,
4446.5s - 4448.0s:  which is a minimum landmass
4448.0s - 4449.9s:  to meet the regulatory requirement.
4450.4s - 4451.9s:  And this has been estimated
4451.9s - 4454.0s:  by Ports Toronto at
4454.0s - 4455.6s:  $61 to $64 million.
4456.6s - 4458.0s:  And I should just do an
4458.0s - 4459.0s:  aside here,
4459.7s - 4461.6s:  and to point out
4461.6s - 4463.7s:  that the cost estimates
4463.7s - 4465.1s:  that were shared by Ports Toronto
4465.1s - 4467.8s:  are based on concept design only.
4468.1s - 4469.9s:  So they are class D
4469.9s - 4471.9s:  cost estimates. They are
4471.9s - 4473.8s:  not including financing costs,
4474.1s - 4476.0s:  Port Toronto project management costs,
4476.8s - 4478.1s:  insurance, and other related
4478.1s - 4479.8s:  costs. And then
4479.8s - 4481.8s:  there's also the issue of escalation
4481.8s - 4484.2s:  that everyone is feeling in the construction
4484.2s - 4484.9s:  world.
4484.9s - 4487.0s:  And so these numbers
4487.0s - 4489.0s:  are bound to go up as they are
4489.0s - 4490.6s:  refined by Ports Toronto
4490.6s - 4492.0s:  through the design process.
4493.1s - 4494.9s:  So this is option one
4494.9s - 4496.0s:  that
4497.7s - 4499.3s:  is really
4499.3s - 4500.9s:  the base for
4500.9s - 4502.8s:  the other options.
4503.6s - 4504.8s:  Option two
4505.4s - 4507.4s:  is the landmass plus
4507.4s - 4509.2s:  two additional taxiways,
4509.8s - 4512.0s:  and a relocated navigational
4512.0s - 4513.8s:  aid. So it's
4513.8s - 4516.1s:  the minimum plus a few
4516.1s - 4517.5s:  additional
4517.5s - 4519.5s:  items for
4519.5s - 4521.8s:  operational benefit. And at a cost
4521.8s - 4523.7s:  estimate of approximately
4523.7s - 4525.7s:  $93 to $97 million.
4527.9s - 4529.2s:  Option three
4529.2s - 4531.1s:  is the
4531.1s - 4532.1s:  landmass extension,
4532.9s - 4534.0s:  the taxiways,
4535.2s - 4536.1s:  a noise wall,
4536.9s - 4538.1s:  a utility corridor,
4539.8s - 4540.8s:  and airside
4540.8s - 4542.8s:  roads, additional airside roads at either
4542.8s - 4544.9s:  end of the runway, which are beyond
4544.9s - 4546.0s:  the runway.
4547.2s - 4548.8s:  And so easier for
4549.6s - 4550.3s:  crossings.
4550.9s - 4552.8s:  The estimate on option three
4552.8s - 4554.7s:  is $169 million
4554.7s - 4556.8s:  to $175 million.
4556.9s - 4558.6s:  Again, construction costs only.
4560.7s - 4562.0s:  This is a summary slide
4562.0s - 4564.3s:  which sums up the three options.
4565.8s - 4566.3s:  And, you know,
4566.3s - 4567.7s:  in general, what one sees,
4568.7s - 4570.1s:  the volume of lake fill goes up
4570.1s - 4572.1s:  with each option. The width
4572.1s - 4574.2s:  of landmass increases with each
4574.2s - 4576.5s:  option. None of these
4576.5s - 4578.2s:  options have an impact on the marine
4578.2s - 4580.4s:  exclusion zone. So the
4580.4s - 4582.4s:  portions of the lake, which are off limits
4582.4s - 4583.2s:  to boats,
4584.1s - 4586.4s:  for safety reasons. So none of these
4586.4s - 4588.5s:  options impact the marine exclusion zone.
4589.2s - 4590.4s:  And none of these options
4590.4s - 4592.4s:  extend the actual runway.
4592.6s - 4593.8s:  So the portion,
4594.6s - 4596.8s:  the runway that is used by
4596.8s - 4598.3s:  the Q400 planes
4598.3s - 4599.5s:  and other aircraft.
4599.5s - 4602.6s:  You can see the cost estimates
4602.6s - 4604.1s:  compared. And again, these cost
4604.1s - 4606.2s:  estimates are preliminary and subject
4606.2s - 4611.3s:  to change. We did some
4611.3s - 4612.4s:  public engagement
4612.4s - 4614.7s:  related to this issue. We had
4614.7s - 4616.6s:  a public meeting which was attended by
4616.6s - 4618.2s:  approximately 250 people.
4618.5s - 4620.4s:  And then we posted an online survey
4620.4s - 4621.7s:  which was,
4622.8s - 4624.8s:  which got about
4624.8s - 4626.9s:  2,900 responses just over.
4628.0s - 4628.8s:  And the top
4628.8s - 4630.7s:  considerations in reviewing the runway
4630.7s - 4632.9s:  and area options include
4633.3s - 4634.6s:  impact on environment,
4635.2s - 4636.9s:  health impacts, impact
4636.9s - 4638.9s:  on Hanlon's Point as a safe, culturally
4638.9s - 4640.3s:  significant queer space,
4640.8s - 4642.4s:  waterfront revitalization,
4642.9s - 4644.6s:  safety and regulatory compliance,
4644.9s - 4647.1s:  costs, accessibility of
4647.1s - 4649.0s:  the airport to the users,
4649.7s - 4650.6s:  economic impact
4650.6s - 4653.1s:  of the airport and its operations,
4653.8s - 4654.7s:  and then finally
4654.7s - 4656.9s:  transparency and public engagement and process.
4657.2s - 4659.1s:  And these considerations
4659.1s - 4660.9s:  are summed up in two reports
4660.9s - 4663.1s:  which are part of
4663.8s - 4665.3s:  the item on
4665.3s - 4667.1s:  the city clerk's portal.
4669.8s - 4671.3s:  In terms of staff findings,
4672.9s - 4673.3s:  staff
4673.3s - 4675.6s:  recommend Ports Toronto's
4675.6s - 4677.6s:  natural compacted open area option
4677.6s - 4679.6s:  one as the most efficient option
4679.6s - 4681.6s:  for compliance. It provides
4681.6s - 4683.5s:  the lowest risk scenario to
4683.5s - 4685.5s:  achieving the mandated federal safety
4685.5s - 4687.2s:  requirements by the July 12,
4687.7s - 4689.7s:  2027 federal deadline.
4689.7s - 4692.4s:  It has a considerably lower
4692.4s - 4693.5s:  project cost.
4694.3s - 4695.9s:  It does not require additional council
4695.9s - 4697.4s:  consideration of official
4697.4s - 4698.7s:  plan compliance.
4699.8s - 4701.5s:  And it provides the shortest construction
4701.5s - 4703.7s:  timeline and smallest scope of lake fill.
4705.0s - 4706.2s:  A lease extension is not
4706.2s - 4708.4s:  recommended at this time.
4708.8s - 4710.1s:  Staff are of the view that
4710.1s - 4711.9s:  a lease extension would require a broader
4711.9s - 4714.1s:  public conversation through an
4714.1s - 4716.3s:  airport master plan update.
4719.4s - 4720.4s:  Ports Toronto's environmental
4720.4s - 4722.2s:  assessment is not a regulatory environmental
4722.2s - 4724.4s:  assessment. It is not a requirement of the
4724.4s - 4725.9s:  federal or provincial governments.
4726.5s - 4728.7s:  It is, however, a requirement of the city's
4728.7s - 4729.4s:  official plan.
4729.9s - 4732.4s:  It's part of the policies that
4733.4s - 4734.4s:  relate to lake
4734.4s - 4736.0s:  filling and
4737.5s - 4738.6s:  other topics.
4740.2s - 4740.8s:  Option one is
4740.8s - 4742.7s:  incremental to options two and three,
4742.8s - 4744.8s:  meaning that options two and three can be
4744.8s - 4747.0s:  implemented in future phases.
4748.7s - 4749.7s:  In terms of the broader
4750.4s - 4750.9s:  conversation,
4751.5s - 4753.5s:  separate from the runway and safety
4753.5s - 4755.6s:  issue, many have noted the need
4755.6s - 4757.5s:  for a broader discussion about the airport
4757.5s - 4759.2s:  and when I say many, I mean
4759.2s - 4761.0s:  the operator, I mean Ports Toronto,
4762.7s - 4763.8s:  the businesses
4763.8s - 4765.8s:  that operate out of the island
4765.8s - 4767.6s:  airport, and then also
4767.6s - 4768.4s:  the community.
4769.8s - 4772.2s:  An airport master plan update
4772.2s - 4774.1s:  can provide a forum to consider the issues
4774.1s - 4776.0s:  holistically. The
4776.0s - 4778.0s:  master plan was last updated by Ports
4778.0s - 4779.2s:  Toronto in 2018.
4780.3s - 4781.9s:  Master plans are typically updated every
4781.9s - 4784.0s:  10 years. However, Ports Toronto
4784.0s - 4785.3s:  has indicated
4786.0s - 4788.1s:  an interest in updating it at the
4788.1s - 4790.2s:  five-year mark or after five years.
4790.9s - 4792.3s:  And they've
4792.3s - 4794.0s:  talked publicly about that
4795.2s - 4795.9s:  in
4795.9s - 4797.9s:  recent months. An effective
4797.9s - 4800.1s:  framework is required to facilitate
4800.1s - 4802.0s:  a robust public and stakeholder engagement
4802.0s - 4803.6s:  process, and this is about
4803.6s - 4805.2s:  the third recommendation.
4805.2s - 4807.3s:  In order to allow for a thoughtful
4807.3s - 4809.3s:  consideration of the issues involved,
4809.5s - 4811.1s:  many of which are quite technical in nature
4811.1s - 4813.4s:  and require some amount of background
4813.4s - 4815.3s:  study, and to provide transparency
4815.8s - 4817.3s:  and accountability in
4817.3s - 4818.4s:  decision-making.
4821.5s - 4823.4s:  These are the recommendations
4824.2s - 4824.8s:  summarized.
4825.7s - 4827.4s:  So the recommendations would
4828.4s - 4829.5s:  authorize staff to
4829.5s - 4831.4s:  execute the tripartite agreement
4831.4s - 4833.5s:  change to provide for RISA option one,
4833.8s - 4835.2s:  the lake filling and the landmass
4835.2s - 4837.8s:  extension, conditions related
4837.8s - 4838.6s:  to the above,
4839.7s - 4840.9s:  and then finally
4840.9s - 4843.1s:  staff would participate in discussions
4843.1s - 4845.1s:  with Ports Toronto and Transport Canada on
4845.1s - 4847.3s:  a process to update the
4847.3s - 4848.9s:  2018 airport master plan
4848.9s - 4851.2s:  in advance of the expiry
4851.2s - 4852.5s:  of the tripartite agreement
4852.9s - 4855.4s:  and report to the executive committee in Q2
4855.4s - 4857.0s:  of next year with a framework to guide
4857.0s - 4859.0s:  this process, including funding
4859.0s - 4862.2s:  requirements. In terms
4862.2s - 4864.2s:  of next steps, Ports Toronto
4864.2s - 4866.2s:  has noted that City Council decisions
4866.2s - 4868.5s:  that would enable runway and safety
4868.5s - 4870.3s:  areas compliance are needed in late
4870.3s - 4872.1s:  November of 2024,
4872.8s - 4874.2s:  specifically November the 29th,
4874.8s - 4876.5s:  to provide enough
4876.5s - 4879.1s:  time so that construction of the new
4879.1s - 4880.3s:  of the new runway ends can
4880.3s - 4882.4s:  be completed by Transport Canada's
4882.4s - 4884.3s:  July the 12th, 2027
4884.3s - 4885.5s:  compliance deadline.
4886.6s - 4888.2s:  Ports Toronto will identify its preferred
4888.2s - 4890.1s:  approach to compliance, recognizing
4890.1s - 4891.5s:  City Council's decision,
4891.5s - 4893.8s:  and the City, Ports Toronto
4893.8s - 4895.7s:  and Transport Canada will finalize and
4895.7s - 4897.5s:  execute an updated
4897.5s - 4898.6s:  tripartite agreement.
4910.2s - 4913.0s:  Thank you. Okay, well
4913.0s - 4914.7s:  now I'll go to questions.
4915.8s - 4916.2s:  Councillor
5014.0s - 5016.1s:  point of order. Councillor Holliday.
5016.9s - 5018.1s:  Thank you, Speaker. Mr.
5018.2s - 5020.4s:  Stonehouse acknowledged that Ports Toronto
5020.4s - 5021.2s:  is in the room.
5022.0s - 5024.4s:  I would like the opportunity to ask them questions.
5025.2s - 5026.4s:  I understand that
5026.4s - 5028.4s:  I have to suggest a procedure
5028.4s - 5030.5s:  in order to do that. I think the clerk
5030.5s - 5032.6s:  advised that we have to go into Committee
5032.6s - 5034.5s:  of the Whole. I don't think that
5034.5s - 5036.5s:  means that we go into closed session
5036.5s - 5037.9s:  just to Committee of the Whole,
5038.4s - 5040.6s:  but that would allow members the opportunity
5040.6s - 5042.5s:  to ask that agency questions.
5047.7s - 5049.0s:  the question is
5049.0s - 5049.6s:  if,
5050.9s - 5052.8s:  just a second Councillor Fletcher, we go
5052.8s - 5055.1s:  in camera, is that what you
5055.1s - 5057.0s:  recommending? No, we go into Committee
5057.0s - 5058.8s:  of the Whole. I know it's unusual, but the clerk
5058.8s - 5060.6s:  advised me that we have to do this,
5061.3s - 5062.6s:  and that is because
5062.6s - 5064.9s:  we need to do that in order to
5064.9s - 5067.0s:  ask Ports Toronto
5067.0s - 5067.9s:  questions.
5069.6s - 5070.7s:  Otherwise I can't.
5071.5s - 5073.6s:  It's my understanding, unless you want to allow it.
5073.7s - 5075.7s:  Okay, I'll have to clarify that.
5075.8s - 5077.1s:  Councillor Fletcher.
5078.2s - 5079.9s:  I'd like to clarify that
5079.9s - 5081.9s:  because I've asked to go into Committee of the Whole
5081.9s - 5084.2s:  previously and been told we can't
5084.2s - 5086.3s:  and only be in
5086.3s - 5088.0s:  camera. So this
5088.0s - 5090.2s:  would be a new great
5090.2s - 5092.2s:  thing where we can go into Committee of the
5092.2s - 5093.7s:  Whole at any time before
5093.7s - 5096.0s:  we decide to do that. So I'd really like
5096.0s - 5097.6s:  to be careful with this ruling
5099.1s - 5100.1s:  because, although
5100.1s - 5102.2s:  I think that's fine,
5102.5s - 5103.7s:  I can't wait for that.
5104.5s - 5106.1s:  Thank you. Councillor Perks.
5107.9s - 5108.9s:  Thank you. I believe
5108.9s - 5110.6s:  the procedures bylaw
5111.1s - 5112.9s:  creates an opportunity for council
5112.9s - 5114.4s:  to receive advice from clerks.
5115.0s - 5115.9s:  On this,
5115.9s - 5118.0s:  by going into
5118.0s - 5119.3s:  the Committee of the Whole,
5119.6s - 5122.1s:  we do more than simply
5122.1s - 5124.0s:  permit somebody else to
5124.0s - 5126.3s:  answer questions. We do things like
5126.3s - 5128.0s:  allow as many rounds
5128.0s - 5129.7s:  of questions as members want.
5130.2s - 5132.3s:  We can alter speaking times.
5132.4s - 5134.2s:  There's a whole series of consequences
5134.2s - 5136.2s:  and I'd just like to understand
5136.2s - 5137.1s:  what those are.
5193.9s - 5196.3s:  Okay, so I'm
5196.3s - 5197.6s:  going to rule that out of order
5197.6s - 5199.8s:  because there has to be notice given
5199.8s - 5202.3s:  in advance and that hasn't been done.
5203.8s - 5204.8s:  Thank you.
5205.0s - 5206.5s:  Councillor McKelvie, questions?
5208.6s - 5210.2s:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.
5210.7s - 5212.0s:  So my first question is, which level
5212.0s - 5213.8s:  of government is responsible for aviation?
5218.3s - 5219.9s:  Through the Speaker, the federal government
5219.9s - 5221.6s:  is responsible for aviation.
5222.7s - 5223.8s:  Who is
5223.8s - 5228.1s:  the regulator? Through the Speaker,
5228.6s - 5229.9s:  the regulator is Transport Canada,
5230.2s - 5231.5s:  a federal department.
5233.1s - 5234.1s:  Is Ports
5234.1s - 5235.3s:  Toronto a federal agency?
5235.8s - 5237.7s:  Through the Speaker, yes,
5238.4s - 5240.0s:  Ports Toronto is a federal
5240.0s - 5241.9s:  agency. Why are we
5241.9s - 5244.3s:  recommending the preferred option
5244.3s - 5245.7s:  for a federal agency?
5247.9s - 5250.1s:  Through the Speaker, the
5250.1s - 5251.4s:  City of Toronto is a
5251.4s - 5253.5s:  signatory to the Tri-Partite Agreement
5253.5s - 5255.3s:  and given
5255.3s - 5257.6s:  that, we have a responsibility
5257.6s - 5259.9s:  to make
5260.7s - 5261.9s:  decisions that are
5261.9s - 5263.7s:  aligned with the city's official plan
5263.7s - 5265.8s:  and staff
5265.8s - 5268.1s:  are of the view that
5268.1s - 5270.2s:  the city's
5270.2s - 5272.9s:  official plan requires
5272.9s - 5274.6s:  that certain
5274.6s - 5276.8s:  things be undertaken in order to
5278.6s - 5280.1s:  provide for leg filling.
5281.0s - 5282.8s:  And so the advice that we've provided
5282.8s - 5284.3s:  to Council through our report
5284.3s - 5286.7s:  is about the Tri-Partite
5286.7s - 5288.6s:  Agreement and our role in
5289.2s - 5290.6s:  approving Tri-Partite Agreement
5290.6s - 5292.4s:  changes. So
5293.2s - 5295.5s:  is there any technical
5295.5s - 5297.7s:  reason for objections to
5297.7s - 5299.6s:  options one, two, or three?
5300.8s - 5301.9s:  I didn't read any in the report.
5302.6s - 5304.1s:  Through the Speaker, in principle
5304.1s - 5306.2s:  no, although it should be pointed
5306.2s - 5308.3s:  out that some
5308.3s - 5310.3s:  of the aspects of
5310.3s - 5312.1s:  the options two and three,
5312.5s - 5314.3s:  some of the
5314.3s - 5315.9s:  ancillary features
5315.9s - 5318.0s:  would require some further
5318.0s - 5319.7s:  design and analysis
5320.8s - 5322.4s:  through a design process.
5323.2s - 5324.2s:  So we
5324.2s - 5326.1s:  have no technical objection, but
5326.1s - 5328.4s:  it might be a little more difficult to work through the process
5328.4s - 5329.5s:  to get it done.
5330.7s - 5332.2s:  Through the Speaker, in principle
5332.2s - 5334.4s:  no. In principle, sorry?
5334.8s - 5336.2s:  In principle, we would
5336.2s - 5338.6s:  not have an objection to the
5338.6s - 5340.2s:  components that are included in options
5340.2s - 5342.5s:  two and three. Okay, so we have
5342.5s - 5344.3s:  no technical reason to
5344.3s - 5346.3s:  object to a sound wall and
5346.3s - 5347.1s:  noise mitigation.
5348.9s - 5351.1s:  Through the Speaker, in principle no.
5351.4s - 5353.1s:  There are a lot of details to
5353.1s - 5354.6s:  support through, including
5354.6s - 5356.9s:  for example in the sound wall
5357.9s - 5358.5s:  where
5359.1s - 5360.7s:  how it would function,
5362.5s - 5362.9s:  how it would
5362.9s - 5364.7s:  operate, and who
5364.7s - 5367.1s:  it would serve. Sure, there's some details, but
5367.1s - 5368.9s:  the principle of mitigating sound
5368.9s - 5370.6s:  is generally a good principle.
5371.5s - 5373.3s:  Through the Speaker, yes it is.
5373.8s - 5374.9s:  Do we have any technical
5374.9s - 5377.2s:  objection to breakwaters
5377.2s - 5379.2s:  or additional runway safety
5379.2s - 5380.6s:  improvements at the site?
5381.2s - 5382.5s:  Through the Chair, no.
5382.7s - 5384.8s:  We would not, in principle, subject
5384.8s - 5387.8s:  to design. Okay, thank you.
5389.3s - 5390.4s:  Thank you.
5398.2s - 5398.9s:  Councillor Moyes.
5399.6s - 5400.9s:  Thank you, and through you Madam Speaker.
5401.4s - 5402.6s:  I also have two questions.
5403.9s - 5405.7s:  Who is responsible for the
5405.7s - 5407.7s:  cost of this?
5408.0s - 5409.7s:  It regards to options one, two, or
5409.7s - 5411.6s:  three. Who incurs
5411.6s - 5414.4s:  the cost? Through the Speaker
5414.4s - 5416.1s:  the cost would be
5417.4s - 5418.3s:  to Ports Toronto,
5418.3s - 5420.6s:  and Ports Toronto has been very transparent
5420.6s - 5421.6s:  about that.
5424.9s - 5425.5s:  The
5425.5s - 5426.4s:  cost would not be
5426.4s - 5428.2s:  on the City of Toronto. Okay,
5428.2s - 5431.0s:  that's good. And one of the
5431.0s - 5433.3s:  things I've heard for
5433.3s - 5435.1s:  the entire time I've been
5435.1s - 5436.9s:  living in Toronto is the
5436.9s - 5439.1s:  noise of the planes.
5440.3s - 5441.0s:  And so knowing
5441.0s - 5443.2s:  that that's a concern to
5443.2s - 5444.9s:  the people of Toronto,
5445.5s - 5446.9s:  why wasn't the noise mitigation
5448.2s - 5449.7s:  factored in in all
5449.7s - 5450.6s:  three options?
5453.6s - 5455.9s:  Through the Speaker, I can't
5455.9s - 5457.1s:  speak to that.
5458.6s - 5459.2s:  The options
5459.2s - 5461.1s:  were designed by Ports
5461.1s - 5462.9s:  Toronto, and Ports Toronto's
5462.9s - 5465.1s:  technical consultants. And so the
5465.1s - 5467.0s:  noise wall mitigation was
5467.0s - 5468.9s:  included in option three, but not included
5468.9s - 5470.1s:  in options one or two.
5471.1s - 5472.8s:  So in your public consultation, they said
5472.8s - 5475.2s:  there was 250 people who attended,
5476.0s - 5476.8s:  and you also had
5476.8s - 5479.2s:  2,900 people who
5479.2s - 5480.6s:  responded through a survey.
5481.9s - 5483.3s:  Did anyone talk about
5483.3s - 5485.1s:  the noise mitigation? Was that
5485.1s - 5487.4s:  a priority for any one
5487.4s - 5489.4s:  group of people that attended?
5489.9s - 5491.2s:  Through the Speaker, noise
5491.2s - 5493.2s:  is a significant
5493.2s - 5495.1s:  topic vis-Ã -vis
5495.1s - 5495.9s:  the airport.
5496.6s - 5499.2s:  It has been a significant topic
5499.2s - 5501.5s:  for quite a while now. It featured
5501.9s - 5504.8s:  large in the
5504.8s - 5505.4s:  Porter
5505.4s - 5507.4s:  debate of
5507.9s - 5508.8s:  2014.
5509.8s - 5511.3s:  There's a subcommittee
5511.3s - 5513.4s:  that deals with
5514.5s - 5515.3s:  sound
5515.3s - 5517.2s:  issues that the airport
5517.2s - 5519.6s:  convenes, and it has
5519.6s - 5521.4s:  work to do
5521.4s - 5522.3s:  in the future.
5523.4s - 5525.4s:  Our view is that the sound issue
5525.4s - 5527.7s:  is a big issue that is best
5528.0s - 5529.3s:  addressed through the
5529.3s - 5530.9s:  airport master planning process,
5531.1s - 5533.3s:  so that the conversation can be about
5533.3s - 5535.2s:  the big picture sound-wise,
5537.0s - 5537.4s:  and so
5537.4s - 5539.3s:  that solutions can be
5540.1s - 5541.4s:  reviewed, or potential
5541.4s - 5543.4s:  solutions can be reviewed with
5543.4s - 5545.2s:  the general public and
5545.2s - 5546.0s:  airport stakeholders.
5547.0s - 5548.9s:  Again, this is a huge investment
5549.3s - 5551.5s:  and a huge undertaking,
5553.6s - 5554.8s:  and I'm still
5555.1s - 5557.2s:  not sure why
5557.2s - 5558.9s:  noise mitigation was not
5558.9s - 5560.0s:  in all the options.
5560.8s - 5562.3s:  That's really a concern to me.
5562.6s - 5564.8s:  So through the speaker,
5566.1s - 5566.8s:  the best I can
5566.8s - 5569.0s:  say is that noise is a significant
5569.0s - 5570.5s:  issue. It deserves
5570.5s - 5572.7s:  a lot of air time, a lot
5572.7s - 5574.7s:  of consideration, even some technical
5574.7s - 5576.8s:  study, and that is best
5576.8s - 5578.6s:  addressed through the
5580.0s - 5580.6s:  master plan
5580.6s - 5582.9s:  update process. The focus of
5582.9s - 5584.7s:  our work in recent months has
5584.7s - 5586.5s:  been on recent compliance
5586.5s - 5588.6s:  and working with Ports
5588.6s - 5590.6s:  Toronto and Transport Canada in meeting
5590.6s - 5592.6s:  the July 12, 2027
5593.1s - 5594.7s:  timeline for recent compliance.
5595.5s - 5596.4s:  Thank you.
5596.8s - 5598.6s:  Thank you. Mayor
5599.8s - 5600.5s:  Chau,
5600.7s - 5602.8s:  I believe that you want to do an
5602.8s - 5604.7s:  introduction at this time. I do.
5605.8s - 5606.7s:  On the point of
5606.7s - 5608.5s:  personal privilege, Council Carole has
5608.5s - 5611.0s:  asked me to help her to welcome some very
5611.0s - 5612.9s:  special visitors to the Council
5612.9s - 5613.9s:  Chamber today.
5615.3s - 5616.6s:  Here from
5616.6s - 5618.6s:  Seneca Hall-Pymay School
5618.6s - 5620.9s:  in Don Valley North are
5620.9s - 5622.9s:  60 grade five
5622.9s - 5624.6s:  students and the teacher
5624.6s - 5625.9s:  Virginia Lone.
5626.6s - 5628.9s:  And the students are here because they're
5628.9s - 5630.6s:  interested in learning about municipal
5630.6s - 5632.6s:  government's responsibility. Let's
5632.6s - 5634.3s:  give them a big round of applause.
5634.4s - 5647.0s:  Welcome. Welcome.
5654.5s - 5656.0s:  Councillor Pasternak,
5656.1s - 5656.8s:  questions.
5657.9s - 5659.8s:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. Through your staff,
5661.2s - 5662.0s:  I always thought
5662.0s - 5664.0s:  it was staff's responsibility to bring
5664.0s - 5666.0s:  us a balanced perspective
5666.5s - 5668.1s:  on different issues that
5668.1s - 5670.1s:  we face here. And I don't
5670.1s - 5672.0s:  really see that here. I'm looking
5672.0s - 5674.2s:  at a summary of the third
5674.2s - 5676.1s:  party public consultants
5676.1s - 5678.0s:  who handle the
5679.6s - 5680.7s:  public meeting.
5681.9s - 5682.5s:  And of
5682.5s - 5684.4s:  the nine bullet points, I see negative
5685.9s - 5686.5s:  phraseology
5686.5s - 5688.7s:  about the airport. From
5688.7s - 5690.7s:  number one, talking about the negative
5690.7s - 5691.8s:  impact of the airport.
5691.8s - 5694.5s:  Number two, talking about
5694.5s - 5696.0s:  something other than the airport.
5696.9s - 5698.2s:  Number six, talking about
5698.2s - 5699.5s:  environmental concerns.
5700.2s - 5702.2s:  Number eight, viability and need
5702.2s - 5703.3s:  for the island airport.
5704.5s - 5706.0s:  And number nine, communal
5706.0s - 5708.4s:  impact. Do you think
5708.4s - 5710.5s:  that this was a balanced
5710.5s - 5712.4s:  perspective on
5712.4s - 5714.3s:  those who do not want the airport
5714.3s - 5716.1s:  and those who think that the airport
5716.1s - 5718.2s:  is a vital economic
5718.7s - 5719.6s:  tool in our city?
5721.8s - 5723.2s:  Through the speaker,
5723.6s - 5725.4s:  the report that you're referring to
5725.4s - 5726.9s:  is the,
5726.9s - 5729.6s:  it reflects the community
5729.6s - 5731.0s:  engagement that was undertaken
5731.0s - 5733.7s:  in what we heard at our
5733.7s - 5735.4s:  public meeting and what we
5735.4s - 5737.4s:  saw through the survey results.
5738.6s - 5739.5s:  And people
5739.5s - 5741.1s:  talked about a range of issues.
5741.7s - 5743.4s:  There were many people who participated
5743.4s - 5745.0s:  who were concerned about the airport.
5745.3s - 5746.9s:  There were people who participated
5746.9s - 5749.1s:  in the process who were
5749.1s - 5751.0s:  supportive of the airport.
5752.0s - 5753.3s:  What we've done is simply
5753.3s - 5754.8s:  record and report
5754.8s - 5757.1s:  what we heard. I think that
5757.1s - 5759.1s:  in terms of balance, the
5759.1s - 5761.3s:  document to
5761.3s - 5762.8s:  source is the staff report
5762.8s - 5765.0s:  which speaks about
5765.0s - 5766.9s:  the RISA compliance
5766.9s - 5769.1s:  as the critical milestone in
5769.1s - 5771.0s:  terms of the airport
5771.0s - 5772.2s:  continuing to operate.
5773.9s - 5775.5s:  Well, even on the staff report,
5775.6s - 5777.7s:  the support for the airport is pretty
5777.7s - 5779.6s:  feeble. Now, let's look at the
5779.6s - 5781.9s:  lease extension, and you're asking
5781.9s - 5783.7s:  here not to
5783.7s - 5784.9s:  extend the lease.
5785.4s - 5787.6s:  And you need robust
5787.6s - 5789.7s:  public consultation. I have
5790.3s - 5791.7s:  a list here of dozens of
5791.7s - 5793.4s:  consultations over the airport.
5793.6s - 5795.8s:  It's rolled on the lakefront.
5795.9s - 5797.0s:  It's rolled in Toronto.
5797.8s - 5799.3s:  Keep it, close it.
5800.0s - 5801.8s:  At what point do we stop
5801.8s - 5803.7s:  the consultations and get on with it
5803.7s - 5806.4s:  already? I mean, it's been
5806.4s - 5807.8s:  debated for decades.
5808.3s - 5810.1s:  And you're asking for more consultation
5810.1s - 5812.5s:  on something that I would consider
5812.5s - 5814.5s:  to be decided policy.
5816.5s - 5817.4s:  Through the speaker,
5818.4s - 5819.4s:  I would
5819.4s - 5821.9s:  draw your attention to recommendation
5821.9s - 5823.6s:  three, which does recommend
5823.6s - 5825.6s:  additional public and
5825.6s - 5826.6s:  stakeholder engagement.
5827.8s - 5829.7s:  Staff will take council direction
5829.7s - 5831.6s:  on whether
5831.6s - 5833.6s:  this engagement could happen
5833.6s - 5835.4s:  or should happen. I think it's important
5835.4s - 5837.5s:  to point out that there are many opinions
5837.5s - 5839.1s:  about the airport.
5840.4s - 5840.8s:  And
5841.4s - 5843.5s:  it will take time for staff
5843.5s - 5845.5s:  to hear from all of
5845.5s - 5847.7s:  the parties in providing
5847.7s - 5849.4s:  advice to council on this matter
5849.4s - 5852.0s:  in the future. Speaker, I'd also
5852.0s - 5853.6s:  like to add that, just to be very clear,
5853.6s - 5856.0s:  this report is about compliance with the safety.
5857.1s - 5857.7s:  And the
5857.7s - 5859.8s:  so there isn't a broader
5859.8s - 5861.8s:  analysis of anything to do with the
5861.8s - 5863.3s:  airport outside of safety.
5863.3s - 5865.8s:  That is not an oversight or position.
5865.8s - 5867.6s:  It's simply that this report is about
5867.6s - 5869.2s:  compliance with RISA.
5869.2s - 5871.6s:  And then we've asked very clearly to provide
5871.6s - 5873.6s:  direction so we can come back with the process
5873.6s - 5875.6s:  to talk about the broader issues around
5875.6s - 5876.7s:  the extension of the airport.
5878.5s - 5880.4s:  Well, for a report that's based
5880.4s - 5882.4s:  on safety, it certainly has some
5882.4s - 5884.2s:  cryptic words about
5884.2s - 5885.5s:  closing the airport.
5886.3s - 5887.7s:  But that being said,
5888.7s - 5890.1s:  are you aware that
5890.1s - 5892.3s:  there's over 2,000 people that
5892.3s - 5893.9s:  work directly on site
5893.9s - 5896.3s:  at the airport and there's 4,450
5896.9s - 5898.8s:  wider jobs connected to it?
5899.8s - 5900.5s:  So through the speaker,
5902.6s - 5902.7s:  again,
5903.9s - 5904.7s:  there are lots of people
5904.7s - 5906.0s:  that work at the airport. The airport is
5906.0s - 5907.6s:  functioning, will continue to function.
5908.2s - 5910.1s:  Those that are not in jeopardy.
5910.5s - 5912.1s:  We have to comply with safety.
5912.9s - 5913.9s:  That is the issue
5913.9s - 5916.3s:  that will compel the airport to continue
5916.3s - 5918.5s:  to move forward. Not anything else.
5918.8s - 5920.1s:  If safety is not
5920.1s - 5922.1s:  achieved by 2027 and these
5922.1s - 5924.4s:  are not done, there will be ramifications
5924.4s - 5926.1s:  through Transport Canada. Very clear in
5926.1s - 5926.9s:  their correspondence.
5928.2s - 5930.2s:  You're talking as if it's a zero sum game.
5930.3s - 5931.9s:  As if we couldn't
5933.2s - 5934.2s:  extend the lease
5934.2s - 5936.1s:  unless we address safety. Why couldn't
5936.1s - 5938.2s:  we have addressed safety and extended
5938.2s - 5940.1s:  the lease? So through the speaker
5940.1s - 5942.1s:  that is in the hands of council, you absolutely
5942.1s - 5944.2s:  can. We believe, as has
5944.2s - 5946.0s:  happened in the past with issues at the
5946.0s - 5948.4s:  airport, there are other alternatives to finance
5948.4s - 5949.9s:  this. The extension of the lease
5950.4s - 5952.6s:  for this, as requested by Ports
5952.6s - 5954.3s:  Toronto, is about financing
5955.4s - 5956.2s:  the project.
5956.4s - 5958.4s:  There are other alternatives to that. However,
5958.4s - 5960.4s:  it is in council's hands to extend
5960.4s - 5962.6s:  the lease, but recognize that that
5962.6s - 5964.4s:  enters into renegotiating
5964.9s - 5966.7s:  the terms of the lease for the
5966.7s - 5968.6s:  future of the airport through one
5968.6s - 5970.5s:  particular item, not through the broad set
5970.5s - 5972.4s:  of issues. But so we're clear, that
5972.4s - 5974.4s:  is in the hands of council and could easily be done
5974.4s - 5976.6s:  today. Thank you. That was your last
5976.6s - 5984.4s:  question. Councillor
5984.4s - 5986.2s:  Burnside, questions?
5987.3s - 5988.6s:  Thank you, Madam
5988.6s - 5990.0s:  Speaker. Through you,
5990.7s - 5992.3s:  so in 2021,
5992.5s - 5994.2s:  so three years ago, it became
5994.2s - 5996.2s:  apparent, decisions were made that
5996.2s - 5998.2s:  some decision would have to be made.
5998.7s - 6000.3s:  Is it normal that it would
6000.3s - 6002.4s:  take the city three years to
6002.4s - 6006.9s:  develop that report? Through
6006.9s - 6009.0s:  the speaker, we
6009.0s - 6009.7s:  received
6010.6s - 6012.7s:  a first report,
6012.7s - 6014.4s:  a research technical study
6014.4s - 6016.2s:  in April of this year.
6017.1s - 6019.0s:  We provided comments and then
6019.0s - 6020.9s:  responses were
6020.9s - 6022.5s:  were sent back in early summer.
6023.2s - 6023.9s:  And then
6024.5s - 6026.8s:  we also learned a lot at the first
6026.8s - 6028.8s:  public meeting of the
6028.8s - 6030.1s:  environmental assessment process
6030.7s - 6032.2s:  in July
6032.2s - 6034.0s:  of 2024.
6035.4s - 6037.1s:  So really, our report
6037.1s - 6038.0s:  is,
6038.6s - 6040.4s:  it follows from
6040.4s - 6042.4s:  the information that
6042.4s - 6044.1s:  we needed to be able to report
6044.1s - 6046.5s:  that was provided to us in this
6046.5s - 6048.4s:  calendar year. So you felt
6048.4s - 6050.6s:  that the process has moved as quickly
6050.6s - 6052.6s:  as it could? Through the speaker,
6052.6s - 6054.4s:  wherever she might be. Well,
6054.5s - 6056.1s:  I mean, I
6056.1s - 6057.5s:  think since
6058.2s - 6060.5s:  through the speaker, since we
6060.5s - 6062.5s:  received the information that we requested,
6062.7s - 6064.4s:  the details on the
6064.4s - 6066.5s:  RISA proposals, which came
6066.5s - 6068.3s:  to us again in the RISA
6068.3s - 6070.4s:  technical study in April of this
6070.4s - 6071.8s:  year. Okay, thank you.
6072.8s - 6074.1s:  In the report, it mentioned about
6074.1s - 6076.6s:  Ports Toronto requesting an extension
6076.6s - 6078.1s:  to the agreement.
6080.1s - 6080.5s:  When
6080.5s - 6082.2s:  discussions began in
6082.2s - 6084.3s:  I would presume 2021,
6084.5s - 6085.5s:  early 2022,
6086.5s - 6087.9s:  was that request made?
6088.8s - 6089.7s:  Can you tell us?
6090.2s - 6092.3s:  I suspect that as a business, they're thinking
6092.3s - 6094.2s:  of amortization of whatever expense
6094.2s - 6096.7s:  they may have to
6097.2s - 6098.9s:  put on through the books.
6098.9s - 6101.2s:  So was that request made to extend the agreement?
6102.7s - 6103.3s:  Through the chair,
6103.3s - 6105.4s:  yes, the request was
6105.4s - 6107.1s:  made. However,
6107.6s - 6109.4s:  it was only recently confirmed
6109.4s - 6111.3s:  the specific number of
6111.3s - 6112.1s:  years
6112.9s - 6115.5s:  the request was refined for
6115.5s - 6117.5s:  a 48-year
6117.5s - 6119.4s:  request. So 45 years
6119.4s - 6121.4s:  plus 3 years
6121.4s - 6123.4s:  to allow for
6123.4s - 6124.8s:  any... Okay, thanks.
6124.8s - 6127.1s:  So the request was made through
6127.1s - 6129.1s:  the speaker at around the time
6129.1s - 6130.9s:  that everything got going?
6131.9s - 6132.9s:  Through the speaker in
6132.9s - 6134.9s:  very general terms, not in
6134.9s - 6136.9s:  specific terms. Okay, and with the
6136.9s - 6139.0s:  decision to
6139.0s - 6141.1s:  not engage
6141.1s - 6142.2s:  in that part of the...
6142.2s - 6144.8s:  to have consultations on that part
6144.8s - 6146.9s:  of the equation, would that
6146.9s - 6148.8s:  have been a staff decision or
6148.8s - 6151.0s:  a city council decision? To only go
6151.0s - 6153.0s:  forward with the
6153.0s - 6154.9s:  examining the runway
6154.9s - 6155.5s:  options?
6160.1s - 6162.0s:  So through the speaker, if I understand
6162.0s - 6164.1s:  correctly, it's
6164.1s - 6165.3s:  in the hands of council.
6165.9s - 6168.0s:  The challenge we had is we don't have direction from
6168.0s - 6170.0s:  council on the broader terms of extending
6170.0s - 6171.9s:  the tri-quartet agreement.
6172.4s - 6174.1s:  So we've asked specifically to bring that
6174.1s - 6175.6s:  back. However, if today
6175.6s - 6178.1s:  other elements that aren't included in our report
6178.1s - 6180.2s:  council wishes to move on, including the
6180.2s - 6182.0s:  term, and modify
6182.0s - 6184.0s:  that, we would then
6184.0s - 6186.0s:  take that as direction
6186.0s - 6188.1s:  and as a signatory of the tri-quartet
6188.1s - 6190.2s:  agreement, you could authorize us to go and execute
6190.2s - 6191.8s:  on that. Okay, so to confirm
6191.8s - 6193.9s:  the extension of this agreement
6193.9s - 6196.1s:  is solely in the hands of council and can
6196.1s - 6198.2s:  be part of any
6198.2s - 6199.0s:  motions today.
6201.0s - 6202.7s:  So through the speaker, no,
6203.3s - 6205.0s:  it could be part of what happens
6205.0s - 6207.0s:  today. You could decide to provide
6207.0s - 6209.0s:  further direction to us. We've provided you
6209.0s - 6211.1s:  what we believe is direction within
6211.1s - 6212.9s:  scope. You could extend that today.
6212.9s - 6215.2s:  Okay, thank you very much.
6230.0s - 6231.4s:  Councillor Morley, questions?
6231.9s - 6233.1s:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.
6233.4s - 6235.4s:  Through you, I have a couple of questions for
6235.4s - 6237.5s:  the Waterfront Secretariat, I believe.
6237.9s - 6239.6s:  And then one for the CFO.
6240.1s - 6241.4s:  I'm also just wanting to start
6241.4s - 6243.3s:  in on one of the major concerns
6243.3s - 6245.7s:  we're hearing from folks on this ongoing
6245.7s - 6247.3s:  discussion is
6247.3s - 6249.4s:  related to access for things like school buses.
6250.2s - 6251.6s:  My understanding is there's currently
6251.6s - 6253.2s:  school buses going across the runway
6253.2s - 6255.2s:  and I'm curious if anyone could
6255.2s - 6257.3s:  advise whether any of the options
6257.3s - 6259.6s:  before us solve for that ongoing
6259.6s - 6260.7s:  safety concern.
6263.7s - 6265.2s:  So through the speaker, there are
6265.2s - 6267.2s:  school buses that use the runway
6267.2s - 6268.9s:  from time to time.
6269.1s - 6271.1s:  Particularly in the winter months when
6271.1s - 6272.9s:  the harbour freezes up.
6274.3s - 6275.0s:  And option
6275.0s - 6277.1s:  three would provide for a road
6277.1s - 6279.1s:  that would be beyond the runways
6279.1s - 6281.2s:  that would allow for
6282.3s - 6283.1s:  a safer
6283.1s - 6285.6s:  and an easier
6285.6s - 6287.9s:  access for
6287.9s - 6289.0s:  school bus vehicles.
6289.6s - 6291.3s:  That's helpful, thank you.
6292.0s - 6293.7s:  I wanted to dig in a little bit more
6293.7s - 6295.6s:  about what we are hearing from members
6295.6s - 6297.6s:  of the public through the
6297.6s - 6299.2s:  consultations that have been underway
6299.2s - 6301.6s:  about what they want us to consider as
6301.6s - 6302.5s:  part of this work.
6306.5s - 6308.0s:  So through the speaker,
6308.9s - 6310.4s:  what we heard
6310.4s - 6312.0s:  at our public meeting and what we
6314.3s - 6316.1s:  saw through the survey in terms
6316.1s - 6318.1s:  of what's also been added to the
6318.6s - 6320.1s:  council debate in terms of
6320.1s - 6322.4s:  submissions to committee and council.
6322.9s - 6324.1s:  We see a range
6324.1s - 6324.9s:  of issues.
6326.1s - 6328.1s:  We have people that want to
6328.1s - 6330.1s:  close the airport and create
6330.1s - 6332.1s:  a park. We have people that
6332.1s - 6334.4s:  are staunch defenders
6334.4s - 6336.3s:  of the airport, users of the airport
6336.3s - 6338.1s:  and everything
6338.7s - 6339.3s:  in between.
6340.2s - 6342.0s:  And it's also really
6342.0s - 6343.9s:  been a challenge, quite frankly,
6343.9s - 6346.1s:  to keep people focused
6346.1s - 6348.2s:  on the RISA compliance issue
6348.2s - 6350.2s:  because there's always an interest
6350.2s - 6352.0s:  in speaking to the larger issues.
6352.7s - 6354.1s:  Sound and noise, for example.
6356.1s - 6357.6s:  Wildlife habitat, for example.
6357.7s - 6360.0s:  There's a range of issues
6360.0s - 6362.0s:  that people want to talk
6362.0s - 6363.9s:  about when they talk about this airport.
6364.3s - 6365.5s:  It's very helpful
6365.5s - 6368.0s:  and reflective of my experiences in
6368.0s - 6370.3s:  office trying to find common ground
6370.3s - 6371.8s:  on very
6371.8s - 6373.6s:  challenging issues. So thank you for that.
6374.0s - 6375.6s:  My last question is for the CFO.
6376.3s - 6378.0s:  I'm wondering if you can tell me about
6378.0s - 6379.9s:  previous projects that were
6379.9s - 6381.9s:  similar in scale and how they
6381.9s - 6383.8s:  were financed and over what period of time.
6383.9s - 6385.5s:  I know there's been ongoing discussions
6385.5s - 6387.9s:  about the various options and the ability
6387.9s - 6389.9s:  to finance. So I was hoping you might
6389.9s - 6392.0s:  be able to shed some light on that.
6395.6s - 6396.1s:  Through the chair,
6396.4s - 6397.8s:  sorry, Deputy Mayor, can you
6397.8s - 6399.7s:  be specific related to the island airport
6399.7s - 6401.2s:  itself or projects in general?
6401.2s - 6403.6s:  Previous projects similar in scale
6403.6s - 6405.8s:  and how they were financed, I
6405.8s - 6407.5s:  gather there was previous capital
6407.5s - 6409.4s:  works required to bring the
6409.4s - 6411.1s:  airport up to its current standard.
6411.3s - 6413.3s:  I'm not sure if there's any other city
6413.3s - 6415.6s:  examples, but
6416.7s - 6418.0s:  a capital project
6418.0s - 6419.9s:  of this scope and scale in terms of
6421.0s - 6422.1s:  have we
6422.1s - 6424.0s:  had experience or have you seen
6424.0s - 6426.3s:  similar examples and
6426.3s - 6428.2s:  successful pathways
6428.2s - 6429.0s:  to financing?
6429.7s - 6431.4s:  Through you Madam Speaker, unfortunately
6431.4s - 6433.0s:  I'm not overly familiar with how they
6433.0s - 6434.8s:  may have financed past projects.
6435.2s - 6437.2s:  You generally would look at
6437.2s - 6439.2s:  the ability to finance your capital
6439.2s - 6440.9s:  investments over a set period of time
6440.9s - 6442.1s:  based on your ability to pay.
6443.4s - 6445.1s:  What impacts are
6445.1s - 6447.2s:  decisions here today going to have
6447.2s - 6449.1s:  on the potential ability for
6449.6s - 6450.8s:  the airport to finance
6450.8s - 6453.0s:  this project one way or the other?
6454.3s - 6455.2s:  Through you Madam
6455.2s - 6456.0s:  Speaker,
6456.9s - 6458.3s:  looking at the option that's
6458.3s - 6460.4s:  in front of us today and the costs associated
6460.4s - 6462.2s:  with that,
6462.5s - 6464.0s:  Port Toronto would look at the revenues that they
6464.0s - 6466.2s:  would generate or ability to offset those costs
6466.2s - 6468.0s:  over the term set to be able to
6468.0s - 6470.2s:  repay that depending on the terms that were established.
6471.5s - 6472.6s:  Very helpful. Thank you very
6472.6s - 6474.0s:  much. That's all Madam Speaker.
6474.6s - 6482.8s:  Thank you. Councillor
6482.8s - 6484.8s:  Bradford, questions. Thanks Madam Speaker.
6484.9s - 6486.1s:  I'll start with our CFO.
6486.6s - 6488.9s:  Would you agree that the remaining lease on an
6488.9s - 6490.8s:  asset generally impacts its
6490.8s - 6493.3s:  ability to access capital and financing?
6496.5s - 6497.7s:  Through you Madam Speaker,
6498.6s - 6499.3s:  in any capital
6499.3s - 6501.1s:  investment you would look at your ability to
6501.1s - 6503.0s:  pay over the time set on the term of the loan.
6503.6s - 6505.2s:  So, if you were looking
6505.2s - 6507.2s:  at a major infrastructure investment,
6507.9s - 6509.2s:  could be in the order of magnitude
6509.2s - 6510.6s:  over $100-200 million,
6511.0s - 6513.2s:  if you only had eight years left on
6513.2s - 6515.2s:  the lease, people would look
6515.2s - 6517.0s:  at your ability to pay that back within
6517.0s - 6518.8s:  eight years. If that was not
6518.8s - 6521.0s:  demonstrable, you might not have access
6521.0s - 6523.1s:  to the financing. That's a hypothetical
6523.1s - 6525.0s:  scenario, but one that people might
6525.0s - 6527.2s:  look at. Through you Madam
6527.2s - 6529.1s:  Speaker, in any financing
6529.1s - 6531.0s:  we would look at two key considerations
6531.0s - 6533.0s:  would be the life of the asset itself
6533.0s - 6534.8s:  as well as the ability to
6534.8s - 6536.9s:  repay the financing over the term. Here's a City of Toronto
6536.9s - 6539.2s:  example. If we had a lease on an office
6539.2s - 6541.1s:  building, as we do, and it
6541.1s - 6543.0s:  was expiring in two years and we wanted to
6543.0s - 6545.1s:  access some capital, tens of
6545.1s - 6546.8s:  millions of dollars to retrofit that,
6547.8s - 6549.3s:  would we have good odds of
6549.3s - 6551.3s:  accessing that capital to do that
6551.3s - 6553.3s:  retrofit on a two-year lease, office
6553.3s - 6553.6s:  building?
6555.6s - 6557.0s:  Through you Madam Speaker,
6558.0s - 6559.8s:  in this hypothetical situation, we would
6559.8s - 6561.6s:  look at alternatives in terms of
6561.6s - 6563.2s:  financing if it was a two-year term.
6563.7s - 6565.7s:  We would also be looking at the alternatives
6565.7s - 6568.1s:  available. Waterfront Secretariat,
6568.2s - 6570.2s:  Mr. Stone, I have a question for you.
6570.7s - 6571.9s:  Ports Toronto has written in on
6571.9s - 6574.2s:  this, and that letter indicated
6574.2s - 6575.7s:  that, quite clearly,
6576.0s - 6577.8s:  there is a risk to the airport
6577.8s - 6579.7s:  if we do not extend RISA.
6580.4s - 6582.3s:  Your presentation and deck here
6582.3s - 6583.3s:  off the top,
6583.9s - 6585.8s:  first slide, said this is not about
6585.8s - 6587.8s:  the future of the airport, but
6587.8s - 6590.0s:  according to that letter submitted by Ports
6590.0s - 6591.6s:  Toronto without the landmass extension
6591.6s - 6593.9s:  and a term extension of the lease
6593.9s - 6595.1s:  which they note specifically,
6595.9s - 6598.1s:  the future of Billy Bishop Airport
6598.1s - 6599.8s:  is at risk. That's a quote
6599.8s - 6601.9s:  from the correspondence. Are you
6601.9s - 6603.6s:  aware of this concern from Ports Toronto?
6605.5s - 6606.9s:  Through the Speaker, yes, we are
6606.9s - 6609.2s:  aware of this concern and it
6609.2s - 6610.6s:  relates to
6610.6s - 6612.7s:  not the landmass extension
6612.7s - 6614.9s:  issue, but the
6615.8s - 6617.1s:  term of the
6617.1s - 6618.9s:  lease as per your previous
6618.9s - 6620.0s:  questions to the CFO.
6620.8s - 6622.8s:  The term of the lease, which is a really
6622.8s - 6624.8s:  important piece here because we've not wanted to
6624.8s - 6626.9s:  touch that, but the letter goes on to say
6626.9s - 6628.8s:  quote, without an extension,
6629.4s - 6630.8s:  securing financing for the
6630.8s - 6632.8s:  RISA project simply cannot
6632.8s - 6634.9s:  happen. When we talk
6634.9s - 6636.4s:  about the viability
6636.4s - 6638.8s:  to implement the safety measures
6638.8s - 6640.6s:  as required by the federal government,
6640.9s - 6642.7s:  we have correspondence from Ports Toronto
6642.7s - 6644.7s:  that's saying that is just simply not
6644.7s - 6646.4s:  possible to access that capital,
6646.7s - 6648.9s:  to make the safety improvements, to comply with
6648.9s - 6650.8s:  the law in order to get this done.
6651.1s - 6652.9s:  They're not going to have access to financing
6652.9s - 6654.9s:  in capital, absent a
6654.9s - 6657.0s:  lease extension. So how then
6657.0s - 6658.9s:  is this actually not about
6658.9s - 6660.0s:  the future of the airport?
6664.9s - 6665.7s:  Through the Speaker,
6665.7s - 6667.9s:  I think it's not
6667.9s - 6669.9s:  the only option that would be available for
6669.9s - 6672.4s:  financing. City Solicitor,
6674.4s - 6675.4s:  would you agree that the federal
6675.4s - 6677.4s:  government has jurisdiction over regulating
6677.4s - 6679.4s:  aeronautics and the Canadian Marine
6679.4s - 6681.3s:  Act? Yes, of course. Okay.
6681.6s - 6683.6s:  And that power could in fact override
6683.6s - 6685.5s:  an attempt by a municipality to
6685.5s - 6687.3s:  frustrate or inhibit their ability
6687.3s - 6689.4s:  to exercise that jurisdiction.
6689.8s - 6690.6s:  Would that be correct?
6696.3s - 6698.4s:  Sure, I think so, yes. Good question.
6698.5s - 6700.1s:  One we might want to think about. Right.
6700.1s - 6702.7s:  Would it be possible that this could be challenged in court then?
6704.7s - 6705.3s:  What could be
6705.3s - 6707.7s:  challenged? Sorry, the
6707.7s - 6709.2s:  decision whether or not to extend the lease
6709.2s - 6711.4s:  or the decision to... Correct.
6712.4s - 6713.3s:  I don't
6713.3s - 6715.6s:  think the city's
6715.6s - 6717.3s:  choice to extend
6717.3s - 6719.2s:  a term of a contract can be
6719.2s - 6721.3s:  challenged in court. No. If that frustrates
6721.3s - 6723.3s:  their ability to implement within
6723.3s - 6725.3s:  their jurisdiction as according to those acts?
6733.6s - 6734.9s:  Okay. I got to move.
6735.8s - 6737.0s:  So just to confirm,
6737.0s - 6739.1s:  the tripartite agreement does contemplate
6739.1s - 6741.0s:  scenarios where the
6741.7s - 6743.2s:  agreement no longer exists
6743.2s - 6744.7s:  or it needs to be terminated.
6745.2s - 6747.1s:  So the parties have acknowledged that
6747.1s - 6749.1s:  of course each party has
6749.1s - 6751.1s:  the right to decide whether or not the agreement
6751.1s - 6753.1s:  continues. Okay. Two quick questions.
6753.2s - 6755.0s:  Chief Planner, under
6755.0s - 6757.4s:  any of the RISA options, the airport
6757.4s - 6759.1s:  as a use is
6759.1s - 6760.7s:  not in fact changing. Is that correct?
6761.5s - 6762.9s:  That's correct. Okay.
6764.1s - 6765.0s:  I'll wrap with this.
6765.0s - 6767.0s:  We have a letter on file here from McCarthy,
6767.7s - 6769.0s:  one of the law firms here in Toronto
6769.0s - 6771.0s:  representing Ports Toronto. I want to quote
6771.0s - 6772.4s:  from that letter for your response.
6773.0s - 6775.2s:  The selection of a specific RISA option
6775.2s - 6777.1s:  not favoured by the city
6777.1s - 6779.1s:  staff does not classify
6779.1s - 6780.8s:  such RISA work as
6780.8s - 6783.1s:  non-essential public work simply
6783.1s - 6785.2s:  because other options exist that are more
6785.2s - 6786.9s:  preferred by city staff.
6787.2s - 6789.4s:  I take it you disagree with that? Last question.
6790.3s - 6791.1s:  The reason options
6791.1s - 6793.1s:  two and three would require an official plan
6793.1s - 6795.5s:  is not because they're not favoured by staff
6795.5s - 6797.3s:  but because they involve Lakeville
6797.3s - 6799.4s:  that is not an essential public work.
6799.5s - 6801.1s:  No, that was it.
6801.4s - 6803.2s:  Councillor Bradford, that was your last question.
6804.5s - 6805.7s:  Councillor Mantis,
6805.9s - 6806.7s:  questions.
6808.2s - 6809.6s:  Echoing on Councillor
6809.6s - 6810.7s:  Bradford's question,
6811.4s - 6813.6s:  if the airport makes a recommendation that
6813.6s - 6815.8s:  we don't allow that to happen
6815.8s - 6817.2s:  by amending the terms
6817.2s - 6819.7s:  and land mass, is that standing
6819.7s - 6821.8s:  in the way of safety and operations?
6826.3s - 6828.6s:  Through the speaker,
6829.1s - 6830.2s:  there are different ways
6830.2s - 6832.4s:  for the airport to
6832.4s - 6833.8s:  achieve RISA compliance.
6835.5s - 6836.2s:  Some
6836.2s - 6838.1s:  options are less desirable
6839.0s - 6840.6s:  certainly to Ports Toronto
6840.6s - 6842.2s:  and the airport community
6842.2s - 6843.8s:  but also to the city.
6845.0s - 6846.5s:  Our focus has been on
6847.2s - 6848.4s:  the RISA option
6848.4s - 6850.5s:  which has, in staff's
6850.5s - 6852.4s:  view, the best chance at achieving
6852.4s - 6854.3s:  compliance by the deadline
6854.3s - 6856.7s:  set by Transport Canada in 2027.
6858.4s - 6860.2s:  So has Ports Toronto
6860.2s - 6862.5s:  been directly asking for
6862.5s - 6863.3s:  a process
6864.3s - 6866.8s:  for a duration, a long duration
6867.8s - 6870.2s:  and can staff outline
6870.2s - 6872.6s:  the chronology of their discussions
6872.6s - 6875.0s:  with Ports Toronto, Transport Canada
6875.0s - 6876.5s:  since December of last year?
6880.6s - 6881.3s:  I'm sorry,
6881.7s - 6882.7s:  could you repeat the question?
6883.4s - 6883.9s:  Sure.
6885.6s - 6886.2s:  Has
6886.2s - 6888.2s:  Ports Toronto been directly asking
6888.2s - 6890.1s:  for a process for more than
6890.1s - 6892.2s:  a year? Can the staff outline
6892.2s - 6893.9s:  a chronology of their discussions
6893.9s - 6895.9s:  with Ports Toronto and Transport Canada
6895.9s - 6898.0s:  since December of last year?
6900.0s - 6901.3s:  Through the speaker,
6901.6s - 6903.5s:  yes, we have been discussing
6904.1s - 6905.3s:  RISA compliance
6906.1s - 6907.5s:  for a number of months
6907.5s - 6909.6s:  now. There were conversations
6909.6s - 6910.7s:  last fall.
6911.6s - 6913.4s:  There was an
6913.4s - 6915.3s:  executive steering committee struck
6915.3s - 6917.0s:  earlier this year.
6918.2s - 6918.5s:  But
6918.5s - 6921.4s:  a lot of the discussion depended
6921.4s - 6923.3s:  on the technical
6923.3s - 6925.6s:  analysis that was submitted by
6925.6s - 6927.6s:  Ports Toronto in April of this
6927.6s - 6929.5s:  year, which outlined
6929.5s - 6931.7s:  the RISA options from a technical perspective
6931.7s - 6933.4s:  and outlined
6933.4s - 6935.3s:  a series of
6935.3s - 6937.3s:  questions to consider. We provided
6937.3s - 6938.2s:  comment back.
6939.4s - 6941.0s:  We received
6942.0s - 6943.1s:  information back
6943.1s - 6945.0s:  in return, and then Ports Toronto
6945.0s - 6946.9s:  had its first environmental
6946.9s - 6949.2s:  assessment public meeting in July
6949.2s - 6950.1s:  of 2024.
6951.0s - 6953.0s:  Through the chair, I know
6953.0s - 6954.7s:  that a lot of my constituents
6954.7s - 6957.1s:  choose to use the airport for lots of
6957.1s - 6959.1s:  different reasons. What I would like to
6959.1s - 6961.0s:  understand more from staff is
6961.0s - 6962.6s:  the medical access
6962.6s - 6965.1s:  side of the airport. At executive
6965.1s - 6967.1s:  committee, Hope Air
6967.1s - 6969.0s:  CEO talked about 3,000 plus
6969.0s - 6971.0s:  flight trips to Billy Bishop Airport.
6972.0s - 6973.2s:  They and their pilots
6973.2s - 6975.5s:  fly to bring patients
6975.5s - 6977.1s:  from other Ontario communities
6977.1s - 6979.1s:  needing Toronto's world-class medical care.
6979.6s - 6981.4s:  Can staff elaborate on the urgent
6981.4s - 6983.3s:  medevac activities through Orange
6983.3s - 6985.1s:  that take
6985.1s - 6985.8s:  place at the airport?
6987.8s - 6988.7s:  Through the speaker,
6989.8s - 6992.3s:  I would distinguish between the service
6992.3s - 6994.2s:  provided by Orange, which is about
6994.8s - 6995.5s:  emergency.
6996.2s - 6997.9s:  If one was in a car accident,
6997.9s - 7000.2s:  one would be transported to a trauma
7000.2s - 7001.5s:  centre via
7001.5s - 7003.9s:  an orange helicopter
7003.9s - 7005.9s:  or a different kind of orange vehicle.
7006.6s - 7007.1s:  Hope Air,
7007.9s - 7010.3s:  there was a gentleman at committee
7010.3s - 7012.2s:  from Hope Air who
7012.2s - 7013.8s:  delivered a very
7013.8s - 7015.2s:  articulate
7016.5s - 7018.1s:  description of what
7018.6s - 7019.9s:  that organization does.
7020.4s - 7022.1s:  They transport
7022.1s - 7024.1s:  people from remote communities,
7024.5s - 7026.0s:  from northern communities in particular
7026.0s - 7028.2s:  to Toronto area hospitals
7028.2s - 7030.1s:  on a non-urgent basis.
7030.3s - 7032.2s:  For example, if people
7032.2s - 7034.4s:  are needing to access
7035.5s - 7036.3s:  chemotherapy
7036.3s - 7038.1s:  or surgeries or
7038.1s - 7040.0s:  other things that are not available
7040.0s - 7041.9s:  in the north or in other remote communities.
7043.1s - 7044.1s:  But just to
7046.6s - 7048.1s:  ask the
7048.1s - 7049.0s:  question on
7049.0s - 7052.6s:  that one, by not
7052.6s - 7053.8s:  doing the recommendations,
7054.7s - 7057.1s:  do we impede on
7057.1s - 7058.6s:  the necessary
7060.8s - 7062.1s:  procedures that are needed
7062.1s - 7064.1s:  for people that live in the north?
7066.0s - 7067.5s:  through the speaker,
7068.4s - 7069.9s:  Orange uses helicopters
7070.5s - 7072.1s:  principally and so those
7072.1s - 7074.0s:  are unaffected by the runway and safety
7074.0s - 7075.7s:  areas, those flights.
7076.6s - 7078.1s:  Hope Air involves
7078.1s - 7080.1s:  the use of the Porter flights
7080.1s - 7082.1s:  and the Air Canada flights, the Porter flights
7082.1s - 7083.7s:  in particular. So
7083.7s - 7086.3s:  it would be important for that work to
7086.3s - 7087.6s:  continue for
7087.6s - 7089.8s:  RISA compliance to be
7089.8s - 7092.0s:  achieved so that the Q400
7092.0s - 7094.4s:  could continue to operate safely from
7094.4s - 7095.0s:  the airport.
7095.3s - 7097.6s:  So for these 3,000, through you Madam Speaker,
7098.2s - 7099.9s:  for these 3,000 plus trips,
7100.5s - 7102.1s:  if we're not able to do them at the airport
7102.1s - 7103.8s:  then we would need to take them to Pearson.
7103.8s - 7105.4s:  That was your last question.
7106.7s - 7108.1s:  That is correct and that's why
7108.1s - 7109.8s:  staff are working towards achieving
7109.8s - 7110.7s:  RISA compliance.
7111.3s - 7112.7s:  Thank you.
7112.7s - 7113.7s:  Councillor
7117.6s - 7118.3s:  Myers.
7121.1s - 7122.0s:  Just one second.
7122.3s - 7124.1s:  Councillor Myers, question.
7126.3s - 7128.9s:  There you go. Thank you Speaker
7128.9s - 7129.8s:  and through you.
7130.2s - 7132.4s:  So I had some questions
7132.4s - 7134.7s:  on the financing piece.
7135.2s - 7136.5s:  So I understand
7136.5s - 7138.7s:  the argument that it would be difficult
7138.7s - 7140.2s:  to secure the financing
7140.2s - 7142.7s:  given that the lease only extends for 8
7142.7s - 7144.7s:  more years. But aren't there
7144.7s - 7146.8s:  other options available for this type of
7146.8s - 7148.6s:  financing like Canada Infrastructure
7148.6s - 7150.5s:  Bank? Like I'm looking on their website
7150.5s - 7152.6s:  and I see they finance the Thompson
7152.6s - 7154.7s:  Regional Airport and the
7155.6s - 7156.2s:  Montreal
7156.9s - 7158.6s:  Metropolitan Airport. So aren't
7158.6s - 7160.7s:  there other options than going to traditional
7160.7s - 7162.6s:  financing companies for this type
7162.6s - 7164.4s:  of deal within
7164.4s - 7165.8s:  the time frame?
7167.6s - 7168.7s:  Through you Madam Speaker,
7169.5s - 7171.1s:  there are a myriad of options in terms
7171.1s - 7173.1s:  of how you might finance a capital project
7173.1s - 7175.3s:  be it how you might be able to support it
7175.3s - 7177.1s:  through funds you have on hand or other
7177.1s - 7179.0s:  financing options as you've noted
7179.0s - 7181.1s:  potentially through Canada Infrastructure
7181.1s - 7183.0s:  Bank or other government financing that might
7183.0s - 7185.2s:  exist. Thank you.
7185.4s - 7186.8s:  And is it normal
7186.8s - 7189.0s:  due diligence for the City of Toronto
7189.0s - 7191.2s:  to sign a 40-year
7191.2s - 7193.5s:  lease without some sort of analysis
7193.5s - 7195.2s:  as to the future impacts
7198.4s - 7199.9s:  or agree to an extension
7199.9s - 7201.7s:  of a lease for this long
7201.7s - 7204.5s:  period? So through the
7204.5s - 7206.5s:  Madam Speaker, I think that's been
7206.9s - 7208.8s:  a bit of the challenge
7208.8s - 7210.3s:  here is that
7210.8s - 7212.8s:  in one sense it's more than a
7212.8s - 7215.1s:  financing discussion. We completely
7215.1s - 7216.7s:  understand the financing piece
7216.7s - 7218.6s:  and generally speaking, particularly around
7218.6s - 7220.9s:  airports, you would finance this with an
7220.9s - 7222.6s:  extension and a term that takes
7222.6s - 7224.5s:  into that account. That's how capital
7224.5s - 7226.7s:  investments and a lot of things happen but certainly
7226.7s - 7228.9s:  in the airports. The challenge with that
7228.9s - 7230.5s:  is, as you point out,
7230.8s - 7232.0s:  it then binds
7232.0s - 7234.6s:  a larger tripartite agreement
7234.6s - 7236.2s:  to a term which
7236.2s - 7238.2s:  we would feel is part of
7238.2s - 7240.1s:  a larger discussion about
7240.1s - 7241.8s:  extending that tripartite agreement.
7242.2s - 7244.3s:  So that's the conundrum that we were in
7244.3s - 7246.2s:  in bringing this report forward as well.
7246.7s - 7248.2s:  Thank you. And just to be
7248.2s - 7250.2s:  clear, so we haven't done any
7250.2s - 7252.1s:  sort of analysis as to
7252.1s - 7254.1s:  what impact a 40-year lease might
7254.1s - 7256.1s:  have on our TransformTO
7256.1s - 7258.1s:  goals or our climate change
7258.1s - 7260.1s:  initiatives on waterfront
7260.1s - 7262.2s:  redevelopment. We haven't done any
7262.2s - 7264.1s:  sort of analysis like that.
7266.1s - 7267.9s:  So through the speaker, I think it would
7267.9s - 7269.5s:  be fair to say that we have
7269.5s - 7272.0s:  in terms of an extension
7272.0s - 7273.8s:  to the tripartite agreement,
7273.9s - 7275.9s:  we have not entered into that level
7275.9s - 7278.0s:  of due diligence around the tripartite
7278.3s - 7278.8s:  agreement.
7280.7s - 7283.0s:  And is it the
7283.0s - 7284.4s:  staff's position
7284.4s - 7286.4s:  that if we
7286.4s - 7288.9s:  that although the preference
7288.9s - 7290.5s:  may be for a different option,
7290.5s - 7292.7s:  option one still
7292.7s - 7294.8s:  maintains the airport as viable
7294.8s - 7296.7s:  for the
7296.7s - 7298.4s:  remainder of the lease, which is until
7299.3s - 7299.9s:  2033.
7301.5s - 7302.3s:  Through the speaker,
7303.0s - 7305.0s:  the staff's position is how do we comply with
7305.0s - 7306.3s:  Transport Canada guidelines?
7307.1s - 7308.8s:  The phased options, the first
7308.8s - 7310.5s:  phase of that, that option one,
7310.7s - 7312.8s:  which can be built on in options two
7312.8s - 7315.3s:  and three, that option one complies
7315.3s - 7316.9s:  with the requirements of
7316.9s - 7317.5s:  Transport Canada.
7318.3s - 7319.8s:  And final question,
7319.8s - 7321.9s:  does the staff have any sort of
7321.9s - 7323.6s:  timeline in mind as to when
7323.6s - 7325.6s:  these further options
7325.6s - 7327.6s:  could potentially be explored, which would
7327.6s - 7329.8s:  include some sort of further public
7329.8s - 7331.6s:  engagement, further analysis on how
7331.6s - 7333.6s:  this potentially fits with our other
7333.6s - 7334.8s:  city building initiatives?
7335.8s - 7336.7s:  So through the speaker,
7337.5s - 7339.6s:  our recommendation is we get on that right away.
7339.8s - 7341.6s:  We bring you back information very early
7341.6s - 7343.5s:  in the new year. It won't take long
7343.5s - 7345.5s:  to develop the framework, and we believe
7345.5s - 7347.3s:  we can get into this work very quickly
7347.3s - 7349.6s:  and move through it swiftly to look at the
7349.6s - 7351.0s:  full tripartite agreement
7351.5s - 7353.1s:  and understand what the future
7353.1s - 7355.1s:  looks like in this relationship.
7355.7s - 7356.6s:  Thank you very much.
7357.6s - 7358.7s:  Thank you.
7363.9s - 7365.5s:  Councillor Bravo, questions?
7366.5s - 7368.4s:  Thank you, speaker. I want to pick up on
7368.4s - 7370.6s:  the question of financing
7371.6s - 7372.7s:  to the
7372.7s - 7374.0s:  Chief Financial Officer.
7374.4s - 7376.9s:  You were asked earlier by my colleague,
7377.6s - 7378.7s:  Councillor Bradford,
7378.7s - 7381.0s:  the importance of
7381.0s - 7383.0s:  the life of the asset in relation
7383.0s - 7384.2s:  to securing financing,
7384.3s - 7386.9s:  but you were a bit cut off on the
7386.9s - 7388.8s:  second dimension, which is
7389.4s - 7391.0s:  ability to repay.
7391.3s - 7393.0s:  And is it accurate
7393.0s - 7395.0s:  that that relates to
7395.0s - 7396.8s:  a business plan
7396.8s - 7398.7s:  operationally to be able to
7400.1s - 7400.6s:  recover
7400.6s - 7403.1s:  through revenue the investment
7403.1s - 7404.3s:  that's been made in capital?
7406.1s - 7407.4s:  Through you, Madam Speaker, that's
7407.4s - 7409.1s:  absolutely correct. That would be a consideration
7409.1s - 7410.2s:  in the repayment plan.
7411.0s - 7413.2s:  And I'm not sure who would ask this one,
7413.2s - 7415.5s:  too, but following up on that,
7416.4s - 7416.9s:  while
7416.9s - 7419.4s:  this was clearly not on the
7419.4s - 7421.3s:  radar, according to all
7421.3s - 7423.1s:  of the documents that indicate
7423.1s - 7425.3s:  the consultation piece, there was no question
7425.3s - 7427.4s:  around the lease extension, and this wasn't
7428.4s - 7429.4s:  flagged during that
7429.4s - 7430.1s:  process.
7431.3s - 7433.1s:  There is now, this has been brought
7433.1s - 7435.4s:  before us in terms of the
7435.4s - 7436.0s:  money that's been made here.
7437.6s - 7439.1s:  Do we know from
7439.1s - 7440.9s:  Ports Toronto what the business plan
7440.9s - 7442.5s:  is at this time?
7442.6s - 7444.6s:  Do we know how it intends
7444.6s - 7445.6s:  to repay
7446.5s - 7448.5s:  the financial investment
7448.5s - 7450.8s:  into the
7450.8s - 7452.4s:  capital pieces that are required
7452.4s - 7454.6s:  here? Because the 40
7454.6s - 7456.7s:  lease extension, to my mind, also
7457.2s - 7458.5s:  should involve questions
7458.5s - 7460.7s:  about a business plan to operate.
7461.1s - 7462.7s:  Is that available
7462.7s - 7464.5s:  at this time? Does anyone know?
7467.2s - 7468.2s:  Through the speaker,
7469.1s - 7470.2s:  we have received
7470.2s - 7472.5s:  general information from Ports
7472.5s - 7474.3s:  Toronto about its approach
7474.3s - 7476.1s:  on business matters.
7476.6s - 7478.5s:  It would use the airport improvement
7478.5s - 7480.4s:  fee, for example, as a revenue
7480.4s - 7482.4s:  towards paying back debt.
7482.5s - 7484.5s:  It's talked about the borrowing that it would
7484.5s - 7485.9s:  do from capital markets
7486.3s - 7488.5s:  and other financial institutions.
7489.9s - 7490.6s:  We
7490.6s - 7492.6s:  have not seen a detailed
7492.6s - 7494.7s:  business plan on this matter.
7495.1s - 7496.7s:  I ask, if you want to
7496.7s - 7498.5s:  stay on your feet, I ask this question
7498.5s - 7500.4s:  in part because I note
7500.4s - 7502.6s:  in the staff report, it says that the
7502.6s - 7504.5s:  airport, under the current
7504.5s - 7506.7s:  lease, has plenty of capacity
7506.7s - 7508.6s:  to expand the number of
7508.6s - 7510.6s:  flights, but is it accurate
7510.6s - 7512.9s:  that no new
7512.9s - 7514.7s:  airlines have expressed interest
7514.7s - 7516.5s:  up to now in
7516.5s - 7518.4s:  operating additional flights out of the
7518.4s - 7518.8s:  airport?
7521.2s - 7521.9s:  Through
7522.6s - 7523.7s:  the speaker,
7525.6s - 7526.3s:  I can't
7526.3s - 7527.9s:  really verify that.
7528.3s - 7529.7s:  Certainly Porter has operated there
7529.7s - 7532.0s:  for years, or Canada's
7532.0s - 7532.4s:  operating.
7533.6s - 7535.6s:  The airport was impacted pretty
7535.6s - 7537.7s:  significantly through the COVID pandemic.
7537.9s - 7539.6s:  In fact, it closed for a time.
7540.7s - 7541.8s:  And flights are back to
7541.8s - 7543.8s:  probably 80% of pre-pandemic
7543.8s - 7546.0s:  levels. So I do believe
7546.0s - 7547.9s:  that Ports Toronto is
7547.9s - 7549.9s:  working with its industry
7550.8s - 7552.1s:  partners is
7552.1s - 7553.9s:  exploring new ways of
7553.9s - 7555.3s:  attracting additional business.
7556.1s - 7557.7s:  I think that that's very much
7557.7s - 7559.0s:  on its mind.
7559.6s - 7561.8s:  So it's recovering but not at the rate that
7561.8s - 7562.8s:  Pearson has recovered.
7564.0s - 7565.8s:  So my next question
7565.8s - 7567.5s:  has to do with
7567.5s - 7569.3s:  what's been asked already.
7569.7s - 7571.1s:  I just want to ask a different dimension.
7571.9s - 7574.4s:  Councillor Myers talked about
7574.4s - 7575.7s:  the unusual
7575.7s - 7577.7s:  situation of being asked to commit
7577.7s - 7579.9s:  to a 40-year lease
7581.0s - 7582.0s:  but without
7582.0s - 7583.7s:  having done the studies
7583.7s - 7585.7s:  or the looking at
7585.7s - 7587.3s:  other impacts.
7588.0s - 7589.4s:  I would like to know, perhaps
7589.4s - 7592.1s:  I'm not sure who would answer that,
7592.9s - 7594.1s:  whether there's been
7594.1s - 7596.0s:  any study of the impact
7596.0s - 7597.4s:  of the planned
7597.4s - 7599.8s:  via rail high-speed connections
7599.8s - 7601.6s:  in the corridor
7601.6s - 7603.7s:  on potential
7605.7s - 7607.1s:  change of modality,
7607.3s - 7609.4s:  change people's shifting to
7609.4s - 7610.4s:  train travel,
7610.7s - 7612.1s:  which is very
7612.1s - 7613.1s:  convenient.
7613.7s - 7616.1s:  And if it cuts down time,
7616.6s - 7618.0s:  could be a competitor
7618.0s - 7619.6s:  in the corridor proposed.
7620.7s - 7622.3s:  So through the speaker, again, I'll reiterate,
7622.4s - 7624.0s:  we have been focused on RISA compliance.
7624.9s - 7625.9s:  So any of those matters,
7626.1s - 7628.2s:  any of those thoughts, as it
7628.2s - 7629.4s:  relates to the airport,
7630.0s - 7631.7s:  have not been part of our conversations
7631.7s - 7632.9s:  nor part of analysis.
7633.1s - 7635.1s:  Right, because what's before us is actually
7635.5s - 7637.7s:  just the safety requirements.
7638.5s - 7639.8s:  So the
7639.8s - 7641.4s:  final question is,
7641.7s - 7643.5s:  we've heard from a few people say
7643.5s - 7645.3s:  it's just because staff
7645.3s - 7647.2s:  prefer, staff want.
7647.8s - 7649.3s:  Can you comment on
7649.3s - 7651.6s:  the obligations that you have
7651.6s - 7653.5s:  that direct, in general,
7653.8s - 7654.8s:  staff analysis
7655.5s - 7657.4s:  when they bring stuff before this council?
7658.0s - 7659.3s:  That was your last question?
7659.3s - 7661.1s:  So through the speaker,
7662.3s - 7663.3s:  our goal is
7663.3s - 7665.4s:  to bring you good advice about how we can comply,
7665.5s - 7668.4s:  particularly when we've received information such as
7668.4s - 7669.6s:  the need
7669.6s - 7671.5s:  to address safety
7671.5s - 7672.1s:  concerns.
7673.2s - 7675.3s:  We are a signatory, we're part of a group
7675.3s - 7677.5s:  of people that have agreed to manage
7677.5s - 7679.3s:  the future of the airport
7679.3s - 7681.7s:  well. We take that seriously.
7682.1s - 7683.8s:  The challenge for us is
7683.8s - 7685.5s:  that some elements
7685.5s - 7688.1s:  of this delve into
7688.1s - 7690.3s:  the second part that we want to get into
7690.3s - 7692.1s:  and we want to have, it's not easy.
7692.5s - 7694.6s:  It would be much easier if this conversation
7694.6s - 7696.2s:  was at another time because it would
7696.2s - 7698.4s:  manage itself. Not for a minute
7698.4s - 7700.2s:  are we suggesting that Ports Toronto is
7700.2s - 7702.4s:  not providing good information about their challenges
7702.4s - 7704.4s:  from a financing perspective. They are.
7704.8s - 7706.2s:  The challenge for us is, where
7706.2s - 7708.2s:  do we go in terms of what we bring forward
7708.2s - 7710.4s:  to you as our governing body?
7710.9s - 7712.2s:  It is before you. We
7712.2s - 7714.0s:  can, we can
7714.0s - 7716.1s:  allow for an extension, as
7716.1s - 7718.1s:  requested and as discussed.
7718.6s - 7720.3s:  That is something that can happen as an
7720.3s - 7721.6s:  extension of our recommendations.
7722.2s - 7724.3s:  We feel there are options that could be
7724.3s - 7726.0s:  explored. However, if Ports Toronto
7726.0s - 7728.1s:  wishes to pursue some of the other
7728.1s - 7729.6s:  options that are in the report,
7730.7s - 7732.1s:  there would be
7732.1s - 7734.1s:  limited ability for
7734.1s - 7736.4s:  other alternatives. The larger the value
7736.4s - 7738.2s:  gets, it really needs to be amortized
7738.2s - 7739.8s:  over a long period of time.
7743.0s - 7743.9s:  Thank you.
7744.7s - 7745.9s:  Okay, before we go
7745.9s - 7748.0s:  to the next question, I would
7748.0s - 7749.7s:  at this time,
7749.9s - 7751.9s:  members, please join me in
7751.9s - 7753.6s:  welcoming the Honorable J.
7754.2s - 7756.0s:  David Wake, Contemporary Commissioner
7756.0s - 7757.9s:  of Ontario, to the
7757.9s - 7760.1s:  Council Chamber. Commissioner Wake has
7760.1s - 7761.9s:  joined us today to observe some
7761.9s - 7763.8s:  of our proceedings. Welcome.
7772.0s - 7773.7s:  You've picked the right day to be here.
7777.4s - 7778.2s:  Okay, welcome.
7778.4s - 7779.8s:  Thank you.
7782.0s - 7782.7s:  Councillor
7783.9s - 7785.9s:  Cheng, questions?
7786.6s - 7788.7s:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.
7789.6s - 7790.1s:  I'm just wondering,
7790.4s - 7791.8s:  how long have we known about the
7791.8s - 7794.2s:  July 12, 2027 deadline?
7798.9s - 7799.6s:  Through the Speaker,
7799.9s - 7801.5s:  that was confirmed
7801.5s - 7803.2s:  this year, and
7803.2s - 7805.8s:  it relates to
7805.8s - 7807.4s:  some statistical analysis
7807.4s - 7809.3s:  done by
7809.3s - 7811.4s:  Stats Canada to confirm that the
7811.4s - 7812.8s:  airport has operated
7813.5s - 7815.7s:  with 325,000 passengers
7815.7s - 7817.4s:  for two full years.
7817.7s - 7819.9s:  So the deadline is
7820.3s - 7822.0s:  related to the capacity
7822.0s - 7822.7s:  of the airport?
7824.0s - 7826.0s:  Through the Speaker, it's related
7826.0s - 7827.6s:  through the number of flights
7827.6s - 7829.5s:  in an airport
7829.5s - 7831.4s:  over a two-year period.
7832.2s - 7833.7s:  And if it's
7834.4s - 7835.8s:  a large number of flights, so
7835.8s - 7837.4s:  325,000 a year,
7837.9s - 7839.4s:  then the RISA requirements
7839.4s - 7841.2s:  must be complied with.
7841.8s - 7843.9s:  Given that there's been a very
7843.9s - 7846.4s:  short runway to this,
7846.4s - 7848.2s:  big investment,
7849.2s - 7850.4s:  is there any opportunity
7850.4s - 7852.8s:  to request an extension of the deadline
7852.8s - 7854.2s:  to buy us some time
7854.2s - 7856.6s:  to work through a more
7856.6s - 7858.2s:  effective process
7858.2s - 7860.2s:  in negotiating a tripartite
7860.2s - 7860.9s:  agreement?
7862.2s - 7864.6s:  Through the Speaker, we have asked
7864.6s - 7866.3s:  this question of Transport Canada.
7866.8s - 7868.4s:  Ports Toronto has asked this question
7868.4s - 7870.3s:  of Transport Canada.
7871.1s - 7872.4s:  And for safety reasons,
7872.6s - 7874.8s:  Transport Canada is
7874.8s - 7876.9s:  concerned in saying that the deadline
7876.9s - 7878.9s:  is not something
7878.9s - 7880.1s:  that is flexible.
7880.5s - 7882.4s:  The airport operates safely right now,
7882.4s - 7884.8s:  but this new
7888.2s - 7888.9s:  regulation
7888.9s - 7890.9s:  is coming in and it must be complied with
7890.9s - 7892.6s:  as other airports in Canada
7892.6s - 7893.5s:  have complied.
7894.0s - 7896.7s:  So really the best fix for this
7897.9s - 7899.1s:  quandary that we find
7899.1s - 7900.8s:  ourselves in would be
7900.8s - 7902.8s:  to be able to get an extension
7902.8s - 7905.3s:  in order to go through
7905.3s - 7907.8s:  a fair process in a tripartite
7907.8s - 7908.4s:  extension.
7910.8s - 7912.7s:  Through the Speaker, I just don't think
7912.7s - 7914.9s:  that that scenario is realistic given
7914.9s - 7916.7s:  Transport Canada's
7917.5s - 7918.4s:  view on safety
7918.4s - 7920.7s:  and the extent to which
7920.7s - 7922.5s:  its operators, airport operators,
7922.8s - 7924.6s:  must comply with the safety
7924.6s - 7925.1s:  requirement.
7925.9s - 7928.8s:  Can option one be designed with
7928.8s - 7930.8s:  rough-in components for option
7930.8s - 7932.3s:  three additional elements
7932.3s - 7934.6s:  to reduce the cost of
7934.6s - 7936.1s:  adding it later
7936.1s - 7938.3s:  if they don't
7938.3s - 7940.2s:  rough some of those components in?
7940.4s - 7941.5s:  Is that an option?
7942.4s - 7943.5s:  Through the Speaker,
7944.3s - 7946.3s:  the staff view is that options two and three
7946.3s - 7947.9s:  are incremental to option one,
7948.3s - 7950.2s:  so option one
7950.2s - 7951.5s:  can be implemented now
7951.5s - 7954.1s:  and the additional components can be built
7954.1s - 7955.0s:  at a future date.
7955.5s - 7958.0s:  We do not have information on the incremental
7958.0s - 7959.9s:  cost of adding these
7959.9s - 7961.0s:  additional pieces.
7961.0s - 7963.2s:  There would be demobilization
7963.9s - 7965.3s:  and remobilization costs.
7965.4s - 7967.0s:  There would be escalation,
7967.8s - 7968.8s:  et cetera.
7968.9s - 7970.5s:  But we have not
7970.5s - 7973.1s:  had information on this, nor
7973.1s - 7974.2s:  has Ports Toronto
7974.9s - 7976.6s:  really had time to consider
7976.6s - 7977.4s:  that.
7978.1s - 7981.1s:  What type of assurance is a city able to offer
7981.1s - 7982.9s:  to help with the financing
7982.9s - 7984.9s:  issues that Ports Toronto
7984.9s - 7985.5s:  is facing?
7987.6s - 7989.7s:  What would help them
7989.7s - 7991.8s:  get the financial support
7991.8s - 7992.6s:  that they need?
7993.0s - 7994.9s:  We'll get the City Manager to answer.
7995.2s - 7997.1s:  Through the Speaker, to date
7997.7s - 7999.4s:  we've not had conversations about
7999.4s - 8000.6s:  alternative pieces.
8002.0s - 8003.8s:  Ports Toronto continues to
8003.8s - 8005.6s:  put forward what their approach would be
8005.6s - 8007.3s:  for the option three piece,
8007.3s - 8008.6s:  which is over $200 million,
8009.0s - 8011.6s:  and how they would finance that through an extension.
8013.1s - 8013.8s:  What is
8013.8s - 8015.3s:  the time of
8016.1s - 8017.8s:  amortization of option
8017.8s - 8019.8s:  one? Do we have any idea
8019.8s - 8021.9s:  of that amount of money?
8022.4s - 8023.8s:  How many years would it take
8023.8s - 8025.9s:  for them to
8025.9s - 8027.3s:  amortize those costs?
8033.6s - 8034.9s:  Through the Speaker, it would depend on
8034.9s - 8036.8s:  repayment terms. I wouldn't want to speculate
8036.8s - 8037.9s:  and give a time frame.
8041.3s - 8043.0s:  This is the last question
8043.0s - 8044.1s:  I have.
8045.9s - 8047.5s:  Maybe, I don't know who can
8047.5s - 8049.3s:  answer this, but what
8049.3s - 8051.6s:  role does Billy Bishop play
8051.6s - 8053.7s:  in Toronto's tourism and economy?
8053.7s - 8055.7s:  Is it nice to have
8055.7s - 8057.6s:  or does it play a critical role?
8057.8s - 8059.7s:  Is there anyone who has insight
8059.7s - 8061.8s:  on its current role in
8061.8s - 8063.1s:  our city at large?
8066.6s - 8068.2s:  Through the Speaker, I'll start
8068.2s - 8070.0s:  and then I'll ask Pat Tobin to provide
8070.0s - 8071.6s:  just a little bit of context.
8072.5s - 8073.6s:  There are numerous reports,
8074.0s - 8075.8s:  and it has been reported
8075.8s - 8078.1s:  regularly, the impact that the airport has
8078.1s - 8080.1s:  in many positive ways
8080.1s - 8082.1s:  for the community. It's not
8082.1s - 8084.1s:  the subject of this report, and this has come
8084.1s - 8085.4s:  to a stop, so that's why I wanted to begin
8086.0s - 8087.4s:  the answer for you, Councillor,
8087.6s - 8090.0s:  is this was not that kind of report.
8090.3s - 8092.1s:  So the absence of that type
8092.1s - 8093.6s:  of data and information
8095.1s - 8096.1s:  means nothing
8096.1s - 8098.0s:  other than we're focused on the compliance
8098.0s - 8100.0s:  with RISA. But Pat, I know there's been
8100.0s - 8102.0s:  a number of reports written
8102.0s - 8104.1s:  and generated around particularly the tourism
8104.1s - 8105.1s:  element of it.
8105.8s - 8107.3s:  Through the Speaker to you, Councillor Chang,
8107.8s - 8108.8s:  the City Manager is correct.
8109.6s - 8112.1s:  Toronto receives 26.5
8113.4s - 8114.5s:  million visitors
8114.5s - 8116.4s:  last year, and it accounted for
8116.4s - 8118.2s:  some $8.4 billion
8118.2s - 8120.1s:  in spending. Two million
8120.1s - 8122.5s:  passengers came through Billy Bishop
8122.5s - 8124.1s:  during that time, 2023
8124.1s - 8126.6s:  as well, and roughly half
8126.6s - 8128.0s:  of those are leisure travelers.
8128.4s - 8129.8s:  It's a growing segment.
8130.3s - 8132.4s:  As my colleague noted, they still continue
8132.4s - 8134.2s:  to strive to reach pre-pandemic
8134.2s - 8136.3s:  levels, which in 2019
8136.3s - 8138.3s:  were 2.8 million, and they
8138.3s - 8140.7s:  are now at 2 million. But
8140.7s - 8142.8s:  Billy Bishop is a critical asset for the really
8142.8s - 8144.1s:  important tourism industry in Toronto.
8144.8s - 8146.1s:  Thank you.
8149.8s - 8151.4s:  Councillor Ainslie, questions?
8152.0s - 8153.3s:  Thank you, through you, Madam Speaker.
8154.2s - 8156.0s:  So not to beat a dead horse, but I'm
8156.0s - 8158.0s:  still trying to understand the financing
8158.0s - 8160.2s:  in the slide deck. I'm trying to
8160.2s - 8162.1s:  understand. So we're looking
8162.1s - 8164.2s:  at three options. Safety seems to be
8164.2s - 8166.4s:  a big concern. My understanding
8166.4s - 8168.2s:  is we're not loaning the federal
8168.2s - 8170.1s:  government any money, but each
8170.1s - 8172.1s:  of the options in the slide deck comes with
8173.8s - 8175.1s:  a cost, but it's not
8175.1s - 8176.9s:  a cost to us. So I'm
8176.9s - 8178.6s:  wondering, and why is that
8178.6s - 8184.4s:  in this? Through you, Madam
8184.4s - 8186.5s:  Speaker, each of the different options have a different
8186.5s - 8188.5s:  cost, and associated with that different cost
8188.5s - 8190.4s:  is the terms that you would require
8190.4s - 8192.5s:  to make repayment. So at
8192.5s - 8194.6s:  a lower cost value, feasibly
8194.6s - 8196.6s:  you could look at a repayment within the existing
8196.6s - 8197.7s:  agreement timelines,
8198.9s - 8200.7s:  depending on what the terms are, what the repayment
8200.7s - 8202.6s:  amounts would be, the initial
8203.1s - 8204.6s:  investments that would be made outside
8204.6s - 8206.8s:  of financing versus a larger
8206.8s - 8208.7s:  cost would require a longer
8208.7s - 8210.6s:  period of time to repay, which would be
8210.6s - 8212.0s:  outside of the existing agreement.
8212.8s - 8214.7s:  Yeah, and so I guess I'm trying
8214.7s - 8217.4s:  to understand. Mr. Conforti is, like,
8217.6s - 8218.6s:  not to be facetious, but
8218.6s - 8220.6s:  why do we care about that? Like, it's the federal
8220.6s - 8222.8s:  government going out, getting the
8222.8s - 8223.7s:  loans, or they,
8224.9s - 8227.1s:  financing. We're not doing any of the financing.
8227.6s - 8229.0s:  So why is that
8229.0s - 8230.9s:  relevant to us today? Through you,
8230.9s - 8232.6s:  Madam Speaker, the ability to secure
8232.6s - 8234.7s:  financing through financial institutions
8234.7s - 8236.7s:  would have a set term tied to it.
8236.7s - 8238.9s:  If that set term extends beyond
8238.9s - 8241.0s:  the existing agreement, there would be challenges
8241.0s - 8242.7s:  in being able to secure that
8242.7s - 8243.8s:  financing to do the work.
8248.2s - 8249.7s:  So option one, two,
8249.7s - 8251.6s:  or three, depending on which option
8251.6s - 8253.1s:  we think they should be doing,
8253.5s - 8255.6s:  is going to make it easier for them to get long-term
8255.6s - 8256.1s:  financing?
8257.5s - 8259.5s:  The different options, given
8259.5s - 8261.5s:  that each of them come with different costs, would have
8261.5s - 8263.6s:  different financing requirements and term
8263.6s - 8265.7s:  requirements associated with that financing.
8266.2s - 8267.6s:  Yep. But I get all that, but
8267.6s - 8269.3s:  why is it relevant to us?
8271.3s - 8272.2s:  So what would be
8272.2s - 8274.1s:  relevant to us would be the ability
8274.1s - 8276.1s:  to carry out the work
8276.1s - 8278.2s:  that's required to meet the safety requirements.
8278.5s - 8280.2s:  And considering that against
8280.2s - 8283.0s:  other considerations that may need to be had
8283.0s - 8284.3s:  specific to the existing
8284.3s - 8290.0s:  agreement. Okay.
8290.4s - 8292.2s:  Alright. Through
8292.2s - 8294.2s:  the Speaker, I'll add that
8294.9s - 8296.0s:  you know,
8297.2s - 8298.4s:  the achievement
8298.4s - 8300.1s:  of RISA compliance, which requires
8300.1s - 8302.1s:  the financing, is
8302.1s - 8304.0s:  the key to
8304.6s - 8306.4s:  the airport continuing to operate.
8306.7s - 8308.1s:  Yep. And I understand all that.
8308.4s - 8310.1s:  We have three options that we're being
8310.1s - 8311.7s:  looked at to consider.
8312.1s - 8314.0s:  But we keep talking about the financing
8314.0s - 8316.4s:  of each one, although the financing
8316.4s - 8317.5s:  isn't relevant.
8317.9s - 8320.3s:  Anything that we're doing, we're not loaning
8320.3s - 8322.1s:  the federal government reports, Toronto
8322.1s - 8324.3s:  money. We're not involved
8324.3s - 8326.4s:  in the financing, so I don't understand
8326.4s - 8328.1s:  why it keeps coming up.
8330.3s - 8331.9s:  So I don't need an answer.
8332.7s - 8333.9s:  It's okay. So my
8333.9s - 8335.9s:  next question, I'm trying to understand the
8336.4s - 8338.0s:  public consultation process.
8338.4s - 8340.0s:  So I'll use my ward as
8340.0s - 8341.6s:  an example in eastern Toronto,
8342.0s - 8344.0s:  southeastern Toronto. So there was
8344.0s - 8345.3s:  an online survey,
8345.7s - 8347.8s:  Ports Toronto did two
8347.8s - 8349.4s:  public consultation meetings,
8349.8s - 8352.1s:  I understand, and then the only
8352.1s - 8354.1s:  one that the City of Toronto did,
8354.1s - 8356.6s:  and at the tail end of the period,
8357.4s - 8358.5s:  was in downtown
8358.5s - 8360.4s:  Toronto. So I'm trying to understand
8360.4s - 8362.0s:  why we only did one meeting
8362.0s - 8364.3s:  at the tail end of the consultation.
8365.6s - 8366.3s:  And so for
8366.3s - 8367.5s:  residents in Scarborough,
8368.1s - 8370.4s:  if they didn't do the online survey, they were expected
8370.4s - 8372.2s:  to go to the Anarchare Centre
8372.2s - 8374.1s:  somehow. I don't understand why
8374.1s - 8376.1s:  we wouldn't have had more consultations
8376.9s - 8377.9s:  across Toronto.
8378.6s - 8380.1s:  If this is like a city-wide
8380.1s - 8381.1s:  used airport.
8381.3s - 8383.3s:  So through the
8384.6s - 8385.0s:  speaker,
8386.1s - 8387.4s:  the consultation
8387.4s - 8389.4s:  and engagement that was done by
8389.4s - 8391.4s:  Ports Toronto, that is being done by Ports Toronto,
8392.6s - 8393.4s:  is
8393.4s - 8395.2s:  essential because it is the project
8395.2s - 8397.3s:  proponent. And as the
8397.3s - 8399.8s:  project proponent, as the
8399.8s - 8401.2s:  manager of an EA process,
8402.1s - 8403.5s:  it is
8403.5s - 8405.2s:  required to do
8405.2s - 8406.2s:  public engagement.
8408.6s - 8409.3s:  The
8409.3s - 8410.6s:  meeting that we had
8411.2s - 8413.3s:  and the survey that we organized
8413.3s - 8414.7s:  was about
8415.3s - 8416.9s:  providing an outlet,
8417.0s - 8419.3s:  one outlet, for
8419.3s - 8421.4s:  public feedback, stakeholder feedback
8421.4s - 8423.2s:  to inform the report
8423.2s - 8424.4s:  that is before you today.
8425.3s - 8427.5s:  In terms of the go-forward,
8427.6s - 8429.1s:  the framework report
8429.1s - 8431.5s:  that we'll come back with next year, we'll talk about
8431.5s - 8433.4s:  process, stakeholder
8433.4s - 8435.3s:  and public engagement objectives.
8436.4s - 8437.3s:  Staff would see
8437.3s - 8439.8s:  this as a city-wide issue and we would
8439.8s - 8440.9s:  want to cover
8440.9s - 8443.2s:  more geography than just
8443.2s - 8444.9s:  what was covered this year.
8445.4s - 8447.5s:  Similar to what was done in 2014
8447.5s - 8449.8s:  or in the lead-up to 2014
8449.8s - 8451.6s:  associated with the
8451.6s - 8452.3s:  Porter proposal.
8453.9s - 8455.2s:  Thank you.
8461.4s - 8463.0s:  Councillor Crisanti, questions?
8464.4s - 8465.0s:  Yes, speaker.
8465.2s - 8466.0s:  Thank you.
8467.2s - 8469.1s:  So at the risk of belaboring
8469.1s - 8470.9s:  the question that Councillor Ainslie
8470.9s - 8472.9s:  asked about the
8472.9s - 8474.8s:  financing and so on, I think
8474.8s - 8476.5s:  we still need a little bit more clarification.
8476.7s - 8478.4s:  I'm going to go back to a comment I heard
8478.4s - 8480.8s:  from the city manager maybe
8480.8s - 8482.6s:  10 minutes ago when
8482.6s - 8485.0s:  I believe you said that
8485.0s - 8487.0s:  whichever option is chosen
8487.0s - 8488.8s:  that it's going to have to be amortized
8488.8s - 8490.6s:  over a long period of time.
8493.8s - 8494.8s:  So again,
8494.8s - 8497.0s:  I want to just clarify, at the risk of
8497.8s - 8498.8s:  also sounding
8498.8s - 8501.1s:  like the commercial on TV, who's paying
8501.1s - 8503.9s:  for this? So maybe
8503.9s - 8506.0s:  you could just pick up on the amortization
8506.4s - 8506.7s:  part.
8508.2s - 8511.1s:  So through the speaker, of course Toronto will be
8511.1s - 8512.7s:  responsible for the financing
8512.7s - 8514.9s:  of this. This is not a city
8514.9s - 8516.5s:  approach and
8516.5s - 8518.5s:  my comments were about some of the
8518.5s - 8520.9s:  more costly
8520.9s - 8522.2s:  options that are outlined.
8522.4s - 8524.6s:  It would require a much longer amortization.
8524.7s - 8526.5s:  If you're talking about a 200 million plus
8526.5s - 8528.8s:  project, there's
8528.8s - 8530.9s:  no pathway that myself or the
8530.9s - 8532.8s:  CFO could see that that would fit into a
8532.8s - 8533.8s:  shorter time frame.
8534.7s - 8536.8s:  So the taxpayer doesn't
8536.8s - 8539.0s:  touch this. This is all ports
8539.0s - 8540.3s:  and finance through them.
8541.0s - 8543.0s:  And again, it's been made clear in the report
8543.0s - 8544.8s:  and also in the presentation.
8544.9s - 8546.4s:  These are concept designs.
8547.4s - 8548.6s:  So I think
8548.6s - 8550.8s:  the likelihood of the
8551.5s - 8552.9s:  $61 million to the
8553.8s - 8554.9s:  $175 million
8554.9s - 8557.3s:  option, that can likely
8557.3s - 8559.1s:  increase by, you know,
8559.5s - 8561.1s:  20, 30, 40 percent.
8561.3s - 8563.3s:  The cost could be even more
8564.0s - 8565.3s:  when we're ready
8565.3s - 8566.6s:  to put shovel in the ground.
8568.0s - 8569.3s:  Through the speaker, it's
8569.3s - 8571.4s:  not uncommon for class D estimates
8571.4s - 8573.5s:  to go
8573.5s - 8575.4s:  up as we get the detailed designs.
8575.5s - 8577.7s:  Not we, but as the proponent we get the detailed
8577.7s - 8579.3s:  designs. Thank you.
8580.6s - 8581.5s:  What is
8581.5s - 8583.6s:  Port's preferred approach at
8583.6s - 8585.8s:  this point? Do we have that clear?
8587.5s - 8588.6s:  Through the speaker,
8588.6s - 8590.4s:  they've indicated the option three.
8591.3s - 8592.4s:  The full
8592.4s - 8594.2s:  option three
8594.2s - 8596.5s:  was what the request was, and that
8596.5s - 8598.5s:  coincided with the request for the extension
8598.5s - 8600.1s:  term within the
8600.1s - 8602.4s:  tripartite agreement. And does it make sense?
8602.6s - 8604.3s:  I looked at option three, and
8604.3s - 8606.4s:  personally I really like it. There's some
8606.4s - 8607.1s:  great
8608.4s - 8610.3s:  additional amenities, if you want to call it
8610.3s - 8612.3s:  that, that are necessary, and that I think
8612.3s - 8613.8s:  the public would really embrace.
8613.8s - 8616.2s:  And when you do this kind of a
8616.2s - 8618.2s:  project and you're in the planning stage,
8619.6s - 8620.2s:  you know,
8620.4s - 8622.1s:  once you're into it, you're
8622.1s - 8624.4s:  best to roll everything out at one time.
8625.0s - 8626.1s:  If we piecemeal
8626.1s - 8628.4s:  it, the cost will continue to escalate
8628.4s - 8630.0s:  over time. Is there
8630.0s - 8632.0s:  no possibility of seriously
8632.0s - 8634.0s:  looking at Resa 3
8634.0s - 8636.1s:  and also
8636.1s - 8638.2s:  having some wording to the effect that
8638.2s - 8640.0s:  we know this airport and
8640.0s - 8642.0s:  how it serves Torontonians and the
8642.0s - 8644.2s:  CTA, and words to the effect that
8644.2s - 8646.2s:  yeah, the lease
8646.2s - 8648.3s:  will be extended. Of course
8648.3s - 8650.2s:  the terms and conditions have to be
8650.2s - 8652.1s:  discussed and debated at a different
8652.1s - 8654.1s:  meeting, but we could have wording
8654.1s - 8656.2s:  to the effect that that is something
8656.2s - 8658.0s:  that we would agree to.
8658.9s - 8660.0s:  So through the speaker,
8660.5s - 8662.1s:  if council wishes to provide additional
8662.1s - 8664.1s:  instruction to staff to
8664.1s - 8666.1s:  negotiate an extension to the lease term,
8666.5s - 8668.0s:  great. That would then
8668.6s - 8670.3s:  not be open for
8670.3s - 8672.5s:  re-discussion as part of a larger
8673.2s - 8674.3s:  set of discussions.
8674.5s - 8676.3s:  That part of it would not be part of
8676.3s - 8678.0s:  our tripartite agreement discussion.
8678.1s - 8680.1s:  So the term would be set and we'd be
8680.1s - 8681.8s:  looking at other things within the
8681.8s - 8683.6s:  tripartite agreement, of which there's lots
8683.6s - 8685.2s:  that we would then do through the
8685.2s - 8687.3s:  longer process. But just to be clear,
8687.4s - 8689.4s:  there would be no ability to go back
8689.4s - 8691.4s:  on the term because that would then
8691.4s - 8693.1s:  coincide with the financing options.
8693.5s - 8695.9s:  It sounds like we're digging our heels on
8695.9s - 8696.9s:  option one.
8696.9s - 8699.0s:  And why is it that we're
8699.0s - 8700.9s:  doing that? Why not leave those
8700.9s - 8702.7s:  options to them? They're
8702.7s - 8704.8s:  running it. They've made
8704.8s - 8706.9s:  some, you know, they've provided two
8706.9s - 8708.9s:  other sensible options. Option
8708.9s - 8710.9s:  three being, from what I see, the
8710.9s - 8712.9s:  most sensible because it deals
8712.9s - 8714.8s:  with other necessary things that need
8714.8s - 8716.9s:  to happen roughly in and around the
8716.9s - 8718.3s:  same time. Sound barriers,
8719.1s - 8721.3s:  underground utilities, and
8721.3s - 8723.1s:  so on. Why not
8723.1s - 8724.8s:  give them the flexibility, let them
8724.8s - 8726.8s:  operate in the way they need to, when they go for
8726.8s - 8728.8s:  financing, go for everything they
8728.8s - 8730.8s:  need, and we support it along the
8730.8s - 8732.8s:  way. And the three partners would support
8732.8s - 8734.8s:  it along the way. So through the
8734.8s - 8736.8s:  speaker, our recommendations are based
8736.8s - 8738.7s:  on where we feel least risk, given
8738.7s - 8741.0s:  the time frame exists. And as
8741.0s - 8742.9s:  has been mentioned by our chief
8742.9s - 8744.6s:  planner, there are additional processes,
8744.6s - 8746.7s:  we believe, for options two and three from
8746.7s - 8748.5s:  a planning perspective. That adds time.
8749.1s - 8750.8s:  The second piece is because we're not
8750.8s - 8752.8s:  recommending an extension of the lease agreement
8752.8s - 8755.2s:  because we think the council really needs to give us direction
8755.2s - 8756.6s:  on the extension of the
8756.6s - 8758.7s:  tripartite agreement. We also
8758.7s - 8760.7s:  wanted to say that we believe
8760.7s - 8762.5s:  there is an option that can work
8762.5s - 8764.9s:  without the extension and still have
8764.9s - 8766.4s:  full compliance with the safety
8766.4s - 8768.1s:  requirements. Thank you, speaker.
8768.6s - 8776.5s:  Thank you. Councillor Sacks,
8776.6s - 8777.3s:  questions?
8778.5s - 8779.7s:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.
8781.2s - 8782.4s:  For the city
8782.4s - 8784.2s:  manager, does recommendation
8784.2s - 8786.2s:  three, in your view,
8786.2s - 8788.5s:  imply approval today
8788.5s - 8790.2s:  for extending the operation of the airport
8790.2s - 8791.6s:  after 2033?
8793.6s - 8795.7s:  So through the speaker,
8797.7s - 8798.8s:  it simply
8798.8s - 8800.6s:  says that we need to talk
8800.6s - 8802.6s:  about the
8803.9s - 8804.5s:  tripartite
8804.5s - 8806.2s:  agreement. And so
8806.2s - 8808.6s:  all of those discussions would
8808.6s - 8810.4s:  come back here. And so if there
8810.4s - 8812.0s:  is, if
8812.8s - 8814.7s:  the conclusion of those
8814.7s - 8816.6s:  discussions was not to the satisfaction
8816.6s - 8818.8s:  of council, that would lead us to a different
8818.8s - 8820.7s:  discussion. But we would be entering into
8820.7s - 8822.6s:  it to look at how we would
8822.6s - 8824.6s:  modernize and extend the tripartite
8824.6s - 8826.5s:  agreement. Okay. But my question
8826.5s - 8828.9s:  is, does the current recommendation
8832.1s - 8832.7s:  imply,
8833.6s - 8834.4s:  give the airport
8834.4s - 8836.8s:  comfort, that we will
8836.8s - 8838.5s:  allow them to operate after
8838.5s - 8840.6s:  2033? Is that
8840.6s - 8842.8s:  in the existing recommendation or
8842.8s - 8844.6s:  not? Through the speaker,
8844.6s - 8846.3s:  that would be our premise
8846.3s - 8848.3s:  going into those negotiations,
8848.9s - 8850.1s:  yes. Okay.
8850.4s - 8852.5s:  So in your view, recommendation three
8852.5s - 8854.3s:  does imply that
8854.3s - 8856.3s:  we will, assuming we can
8856.3s - 8858.2s:  reach an agreement, allow
8858.2s - 8860.5s:  the airport to operate after 2033?
8861.1s - 8862.0s:  Through the speaker, correct.
8862.4s - 8864.4s:  And in your
8864.4s - 8866.4s:  view, have we consulted
8866.4s - 8868.3s:  the public on that question?
8870.6s - 8871.1s:  Through the
8871.1s - 8871.7s:  speaker,
8873.6s - 8875.6s:  not in the immediate term, no.
8875.6s - 8877.9s:  I think, and I'm
8877.9s - 8879.7s:  careful here because I don't have the full history,
8879.8s - 8881.6s:  but I think over the course of history, those
8881.6s - 8883.6s:  questions have been asked, but we have not
8883.6s - 8885.6s:  asked any of those questions because this
8885.6s - 8887.9s:  has been simply about complying with a safety
8887.9s - 8889.7s:  standard. In the
8889.7s - 8891.7s:  absence of the requirement to comply with
8891.7s - 8893.7s:  this, would this
8893.7s - 8895.7s:  discussion even be happening at this stage? I don't
8895.7s - 8897.7s:  know. Right. So
8897.7s - 8899.7s:  we haven't consulted the public
8899.7s - 8901.4s:  explicitly on it.
8901.4s - 8903.7s:  And we haven't consulted the public explicitly
8903.7s - 8906.1s:  on what types
8907.0s - 8908.2s:  of aviation
8908.2s - 8910.2s:  we should allow at this location,
8910.4s - 8911.7s:  correct? We haven't discussed
8911.7s - 8914.1s:  whether we should allow billionaire private planes.
8914.1s - 8916.2s:  We haven't discussed the
8916.2s - 8918.2s:  types of choices that could be held.
8918.4s - 8919.9s:  We haven't had that conversation yet.
8920.2s - 8921.3s:  Through the speaker, no, we have not.
8921.8s - 8923.9s:  And in particular, the agreement
8923.9s - 8925.8s:  right now calls for this to be a general
8925.8s - 8927.2s:  aviation airport,
8928.1s - 8929.3s:  private planes,
8929.9s - 8931.8s:  plus some limited commercial.
8931.8s - 8933.8s:  We haven't discussed with the public whether
8933.8s - 8935.9s:  we want to have continuing
8935.9s - 8938.1s:  private planes at this airport
8938.1s - 8939.7s:  burning leaded gas, right?
8940.4s - 8942.0s:  Through the speaker, no, those
8942.0s - 8943.9s:  would be the kinds of conversations that would
8943.9s - 8945.7s:  happen. Right. But right now,
8945.7s - 8948.0s:  the private planes at this location
8948.0s - 8949.7s:  are burning
8949.7s - 8951.3s:  leaded fuel,
8952.2s - 8954.1s:  lead being a neurotoxin with lifelong
8954.1s - 8955.9s:  impacts on the health of people exposed to
8955.9s - 8958.5s:  it, right? Through the
8958.5s - 8960.4s:  speaker, that is my understanding.
8962.0s - 8962.8s:  And lead
8962.8s - 8964.9s:  is an element. It never disappears.
8965.0s - 8966.7s:  It doesn't just
8966.7s - 8968.4s:  damage the people it falls on.
8968.6s - 8970.6s:  It damages people who are exposed to it
8970.6s - 8972.5s:  year after year after year, correct?
8973.3s - 8974.4s:  Through the speaker, correct.
8974.4s - 8976.3s:  And one of the real principles
8976.3s - 8978.5s:  that we would enter into this conversation is the
8978.5s - 8980.7s:  environmental concerns in the broadest
8980.7s - 8982.6s:  sense of the environmental concerns for the airport
8982.6s - 8984.5s:  for sure. Right. And that includes the air
8984.5s - 8986.8s:  quality concerns, which have been well
8986.8s - 8988.6s:  documented and have serious,
8988.6s - 8990.9s:  can have serious adverse effects on people.
8991.8s - 8992.7s:  Through the speaker, correct.
8993.0s - 8994.7s:  This would be a chance to modernize
8994.7s - 8996.7s:  our agreement and really bring it in
8996.7s - 8998.7s:  line with some of the other things that we're trying to accomplish
8998.7s - 9001.0s:  as a city. Okay. So
9001.0s - 9002.7s:  what would you have to
9002.7s - 9004.6s:  do before you can bring to us
9004.6s - 9006.5s:  an explicit recommendation
9007.7s - 9008.6s:  on whether
9008.6s - 9010.6s:  we should continue to have an airport
9010.6s - 9011.6s:  on these lands?
9012.4s - 9014.5s:  Through the speaker, we've recommended a
9014.5s - 9016.6s:  two-phase approach to that. One is to bring you back
9016.6s - 9018.6s:  the framework for the discussion, to talk about
9018.6s - 9020.4s:  the areas that we will be exploring,
9020.9s - 9022.6s:  both to do some technical analysis
9022.6s - 9024.7s:  as you suggested in a couple of areas, and then
9024.7s - 9027.0s:  the second piece is the time frame for the discussions
9027.9s - 9028.9s:  with the parties
9028.9s - 9030.6s:  that would be involved in it. So
9030.6s - 9032.7s:  the first piece to come back is the framework
9032.7s - 9034.7s:  for those discussions, and then we would enter
9034.7s - 9036.7s:  into that process and bring back the
9036.7s - 9038.8s:  results. Right. Mr. Johnson,
9039.1s - 9040.9s:  doesn't that expose the airport,
9041.0s - 9042.6s:  the airlines, the pilots,
9043.4s - 9044.7s:  the residents, everyone
9044.7s - 9046.8s:  who has to make long-term decisions
9046.8s - 9049.1s:  to a prolonged period of uncertainty
9049.8s - 9051.0s:  as to the future
9051.0s - 9052.8s:  of the airport? Is it going to be airport? Is it
9052.8s - 9054.7s:  going to be parks? Is it going to be something else?
9056.2s - 9056.9s:  So through the speaker,
9057.3s - 9059.2s:  I think I've answered what the premise entering into
9059.2s - 9060.4s:  it is. So the
9061.0s - 9063.0s:  is it a wide-open question? It's not a green field
9063.0s - 9065.0s:  exercise. We're looking to modernize an agreement.
9065.3s - 9067.1s:  The second piece is this is not something that
9067.1s - 9068.8s:  needs to take years and years to complete.
9069.1s - 9071.0s:  We can get on it and do this work
9071.0s - 9073.3s:  in fairly short order. I do believe,
9073.3s - 9075.5s:  however, though, it does require some analysis.
9075.6s - 9077.3s:  It does require some due diligence. It does
9077.3s - 9079.2s:  require some engagement, and
9079.2s - 9081.3s:  that can't happen in days and weeks. It's going to
9081.3s - 9082.7s:  take some months to make that happen.
9083.3s - 9085.3s:  Thank you. That's it. That was your last
9085.3s - 9089.9s:  question. Councillor
9091.7s - 9092.2s:  Candoval.
9092.6s - 9093.1s:  Questions.
9094.0s - 9096.3s:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, and through you
9096.3s - 9098.3s:  to pick up on
9098.3s - 9100.3s:  some of the earlier questions about
9100.3s - 9102.2s:  public consultation
9102.2s - 9104.2s:  through you to staff.
9106.0s - 9108.3s:  To start broadly, does this
9108.3s - 9109.9s:  does staff view this issue
9109.9s - 9111.2s:  as a city-wide issue?
9112.5s - 9114.0s:  Through the speaker, yes.
9114.7s - 9116.5s:  Thank you. My
9116.5s - 9118.5s:  understanding is the notice for
9118.5s - 9120.1s:  public consultation was
9120.1s - 9122.5s:  issued eight days prior to the meeting.
9122.6s - 9123.2s:  Is that correct?
9125.0s - 9126.9s:  So through the speaker, sorry
9126.9s - 9129.1s:  Councillor, I took your previous question to talk
9129.1s - 9130.7s:  about engagement in the future.
9131.2s - 9133.1s:  David will have to answer the question about the engagement
9133.1s - 9134.0s:  we just went through.
9134.0s - 9136.6s:  So through the speaker, yes,
9136.6s - 9138.6s:  the notice was
9138.6s - 9140.2s:  just eight days.
9140.2s - 9142.1s:  That sounds right. Not ideal.
9143.2s - 9144.5s:  Staff admit that.
9144.9s - 9146.3s:  Not consistent with
9147.1s - 9148.4s:  City of Toronto
9148.4s - 9150.4s:  best practices in terms of stakeholder
9150.4s - 9152.3s:  and community engagement. And I understand
9152.3s - 9154.5s:  the location of the
9154.5s - 9156.4s:  consultation was a challenge
9156.4s - 9158.2s:  for folks who may not live
9158.2s - 9160.4s:  in the vicinity.
9161.9s - 9162.8s:  Was that
9162.8s - 9164.0s:  were those challenges
9164.7s - 9166.8s:  were staff aware that the location
9166.8s - 9168.8s:  would pose
9168.8s - 9170.3s:  a challenge to the
9170.3s - 9172.3s:  residents from across the city?
9174.2s - 9175.0s:  Through the speaker,
9175.9s - 9177.5s:  we needed to find
9177.5s - 9179.9s:  a room that was
9179.9s - 9181.8s:  large enough and
9181.8s - 9183.3s:  available and
9183.3s - 9185.4s:  so that's where we ended up at
9185.4s - 9186.3s:  Exhibition Place.
9187.3s - 9189.8s:  I think in the future we would want to
9189.8s - 9191.7s:  have meetings
9191.7s - 9194.2s:  in other parts of the city and then also
9194.2s - 9195.2s:  online. Fair enough.
9196.1s - 9197.9s:  Was there any attempt made by staff
9197.9s - 9199.8s:  to live stream the meeting for
9199.8s - 9202.2s:  folks who would be unavailable
9202.2s - 9204.1s:  or unable to attend
9204.1s - 9204.7s:  in person?
9206.0s - 9208.4s:  Through the speaker, no, we
9208.4s - 9210.3s:  settled on an in person meeting only
9210.3s - 9211.8s:  with the survey to
9211.8s - 9214.1s:  To clarify for the public, we do
9214.1s - 9216.2s:  have the technology to live
9216.2s - 9218.1s:  stream a meeting as we do
9218.1s - 9219.6s:  with other public consultations?
9219.6s - 9220.6s:  That is correct.
9221.2s - 9223.8s:  Were there any attempts to
9223.8s - 9226.1s:  coordinate a virtual
9226.1s - 9227.4s:  public consultation
9227.4s - 9229.9s:  in light of the difficulties
9231.2s - 9232.1s:  of
9232.1s - 9233.7s:  live streaming it? Were there
9233.7s - 9235.8s:  attempts to create an online
9235.8s - 9237.2s:  Zoom or WebEx option?
9238.7s - 9240.4s:  Through the speaker, we did not
9240.4s - 9241.3s:  offer that option.
9246.0s - 9248.5s:  With many public consultations
9248.5s - 9250.5s:  and I see this locally
9250.5s - 9253.5s:  with city staff
9253.5s - 9254.7s:  from PFR
9255.0s - 9257.1s:  seeking community
9257.6s - 9259.2s:  feedback on park
9259.2s - 9261.2s:  revitalization, paid
9261.2s - 9263.3s:  ads are placed in social media
9263.8s - 9265.4s:  for surveys.
9266.2s - 9267.2s:  Was the
9267.2s - 9268.5s:  survey conducted
9269.1s - 9270.3s:  by staff,
9271.1s - 9273.2s:  did staff utilize any paid
9273.2s - 9273.7s:  promotion?
9276.4s - 9278.8s:  Through the speaker, we did
9278.8s - 9280.9s:  make use of City of Toronto social media
9281.6s - 9283.2s:  but I do not believe
9283.2s - 9284.2s:  that we placed ads.
9285.1s - 9286.3s:  Do you think if we're
9286.8s - 9288.7s:  placing paid ads on
9288.7s - 9289.8s:  park feedback,
9290.7s - 9291.9s:  do you think for
9292.7s - 9295.0s:  an issue of significant impact
9295.0s - 9296.7s:  that is truly city
9296.7s - 9297.6s:  wide,
9298.3s - 9300.7s:  would it be fair to say that
9300.7s - 9302.7s:  should also receive paid ad
9302.7s - 9304.1s:  promotion on the survey?
9305.5s - 9307.0s:  Through the speaker, going forward
9307.0s - 9308.8s:  and as we talk about the tripartite agreement
9308.8s - 9311.0s:  moving forward on that, it will be a very robust
9312.1s - 9312.6s:  process.
9313.3s - 9315.2s:  There will be paid ads, there will be
9315.2s - 9317.1s:  locations in parts of the city,
9317.2s - 9319.0s:  different parts of the city, so I think
9319.0s - 9321.0s:  moving forward on the real questions that
9321.0s - 9322.9s:  will be of importance to the City of Toronto,
9323.2s - 9324.9s:  we will be following that practice.
9325.4s - 9326.8s:  Thank you and
9326.8s - 9329.1s:  in light of the survey,
9329.4s - 9330.8s:  the two question survey,
9331.3s - 9333.0s:  do staff believe that's an
9333.9s - 9334.4s:  exhaustive,
9335.2s - 9337.0s:  the two questions, exhaustive set
9337.0s - 9338.6s:  of questions to elicit feedback
9338.6s - 9340.8s:  from the body public?
9343.7s - 9344.5s:  Through the speaker,
9346.2s - 9347.3s:  the staff
9347.3s - 9349.5s:  worked on the two questions,
9349.6s - 9351.3s:  first of all to try and get
9352.4s - 9353.0s:  respondents
9353.0s - 9355.2s:  to the survey and public
9355.2s - 9357.1s:  meeting participants to focus on
9357.1s - 9359.5s:  the RISA issue and then the second
9359.5s - 9360.8s:  question was
9360.8s - 9363.1s:  used as a
9363.1s - 9365.1s:  vehicle for people to provide comment
9365.1s - 9367.1s:  on the broader set of
9367.1s - 9368.6s:  issues that we would
9369.0s - 9370.9s:  want to be part of
9370.9s - 9372.9s:  the more comprehensive
9372.9s - 9374.6s:  conversation about the future of the report.
9375.4s - 9376.0s:  Lastly,
9377.0s - 9379.4s:  on the water, the second question
9379.4s - 9380.2s:  framed
9381.1s - 9383.5s:  the consultation and the question
9383.5s - 9384.4s:  around
9385.1s - 9386.3s:  the waterfront.
9386.5s - 9389.5s:  Do staff believe this is
9389.5s - 9391.2s:  strictly a waterfront
9391.2s - 9391.7s:  issue?
9392.9s - 9394.2s:  That was your last question?
9394.2s - 9396.3s:  Through the speakers, I think staff
9396.3s - 9398.5s:  are of the view that it is at the same time
9398.5s - 9400.2s:  a waterfront issue, a downtown
9400.2s - 9402.4s:  issue and a citywide issue and
9402.4s - 9404.1s:  actually a regional issue as well.
9404.7s - 9406.4s:  Okay, thank you. We'll recess to
9406.4s - 9407.0s:  two o'clock.
