0.0s - 1.6s:  So good to finally get you on the show.
1.8s - 3.3s:  Thank you. It's so good to be here.
3.3s - 3.8s:  You know, it's funny.
3.8s - 5.3s:  I was thinking about this the other day.
5.3s - 8.4s:  If you don't pay me what you owe me, I'm going to remove the life from your body.
8.5s - 10.0s:  Oh, OK. Come on, York.
10.1s - 12.1s:  That's uncalled for. You know, I'm good for it.
12.2s - 14.1s:  I gave you teeth. You did not pay me.
14.2s - 15.7s:  What do you think this is? Health care for you?
15.9s - 17.3s:  No, what? I don't care about health.
17.4s - 19.3s:  I'm just light right now. That's all.
19.6s - 23.7s:  Oh, you're light like the little feather of the morning dove.
23.7s - 28.8s:  I could drop you from the tallest roof and you'll just lightly float on down,
28.8s - 34.4s:  landing like a tired youngling slowly resting their head to sleep in their soft crib.
34.9s - 36.6s:  That's so poetically aggressive.
36.8s - 37.7s:  You need to pay me.
37.9s - 40.1s:  Look, Unanswered Oddities hasn't been doing too hot,
40.2s - 43.2s:  but the show is about to get renewed for next season and I should get in advance.
43.3s - 45.3s:  Then I'll get you paid and we'll laugh about this.
45.5s - 46.4s:  I have never laughed.
46.5s - 48.3s:  That's super interesting. Let's talk about that.
48.3s - 49.8s:  We've got a lot of topics to cover today.
49.9s - 52.1s:  The Valley Phantom, the benefits of horse spit.
52.3s - 53.8s:  I wink at your horse spit.
54.0s - 56.1s:  Come on, York. What about the power of love?
56.2s - 57.4s:  I thought we were like family.
57.4s - 60.2s:  Tiggy, you know that I love you like a brother that I sell drugs to,
60.2s - 63.0s:  but I also love getting paid. And so does my employer.
63.4s - 65.3s:  And Barko will not be as nice as I am.
65.5s - 68.2s:  You are a nice guy though, York. Don't forget that.
68.4s - 70.1s:  I am going to tell you a story.
70.2s - 72.1s:  Please, anything other than you asking me to pay you.
72.2s - 75.5s:  When I was littler, I had to put an end to my own father.
75.6s - 76.0s:  You mean?
76.1s - 76.8s:  The big nap.
77.0s - 77.4s:  Why?
77.7s - 79.9s:  Because he got upset that I put an end to my mother.
80.2s - 81.0s:  And there you have it.
81.2s - 82.0s:  That's the story?
82.2s - 83.4s:  Well, the long person, yes.
83.6s - 87.3s:  The point is, do not make me treat you like my mama and papa.
87.3s - 89.3s:  Okay. Okay. I've got a sponsor.
89.6s - 92.0s:  That'll cover some of what I owe you. I just got to do the ad read.
92.1s - 93.8s:  Well, why didn't you say that from the start?
94.1s - 95.6s:  Do the ad read to get me paid.
96.0s - 97.4s:  Okay. Well, let's see here.
98.6s - 102.0s:  Um, TikTok is brought to you by Pong Kordo's Tooth Booth.
102.1s - 102.6s:  You bastard.
